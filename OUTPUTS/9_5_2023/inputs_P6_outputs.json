We repeated this process about a dozen times or more until everything was read and processed in the mailbox.\n\nAfter the final batch of emails was processed manually (with the help of the reader job), the mailbox's entire inbox was cleared and as a test, we wanted to see what would happen, but the issue remains. \n\nWhen we visit the 'Email Diagnostics' page, it will occasionally say that email sending is non-operational, but will retain its status of 'active' and 'enabled' across the board, with one of the stats showing high processing time (upwards of 40,000ms). \n\nThis issue appears to have started yesterday at some point, and even with these issues, outbound email remained functional and responsive. \n\nThe primary issue as it stands now is that the mailbox has to be maintained manually, else emails are not being processed automatically. \n\nMore information:\n- Mailbox is configured via OAuth, connecting to Azure AD\n- Both connection methods were still valid and reporting a successful connection (IMAP and SMTP)\nwork_notes:  The Instance morsco  has SNC Access Control plugin set to enabled  \nFeedback for AIOps\nwork_notes: morsco.service-now.comSTATUS OF EVENTS & EMAILSCounts are taken at the time of reporting and may differ from those observed in links.Number of Events not in Processed or Error10Number of Inbound Emails in Ready State440Number of Outbound Emails in Ready State0Is Servicenow POP3 Email Account ActiveFALSEIs Servicenow SMTP Email Account ActiveFALSEEMAIL READER JOB STATUSEmail ReaderReadySMTP SENDER JOB STATUSSMTP Sender 2ReadySMTP SenderReady \nFeedback for AIOps\nu_hop_notes: HOP rights have been granted to user: Madhukar Regmi (NOW)\nu_hop_notes: HOP rights have been granted to user: Ravi Yedla (NOW)\ncomments: Hello  Dylan , \n \n My name is Madhukar, and I will assist you with your Case. I would like to confirm the following is correct for the issue you are currently facing:  \n \n \nCASE SUMMARY: \nEmail Reader is slow and is not processing as per expectation. \n \nIssue: \nSlow email reader. \n \nBusiness Impact:  \nInbound email processing \n \nSteps to Reproduce:    \nSend emails to the instance. \n \nInvestigation Summary:    \n- Mailbox is configured via OAuth, connecting to Azure AD \n- Both connection methods were still valid and reporting a successful connection (IMAP and SMTP) \n \nSNC access required: Please provide SNC access to 'madhukar.regmi'. \n \nNext Steps:   \nKindly provide SNC access to the instance to user id 'madhukar.regmi'. Please create a fresh record for this. \nAlso kindly let us know some of the email where they are read and not removed so we can check the records on our end. \n \n*** \nIf you need immediate assistance, please use one of the contact numbers from our support contact page: \nhttp://www.servicenow.com/support/contact-support.htmlYou will then be able to enter your Incident or Change number over the phone to have your call routed to the engineer that owns that Incident or Change. \n \nAs part of the troubleshooting process, I and other ServiceNow personnel may need to access your instance(s) in order to review the service impact to your instance(s) and to determine the root cause. It may also be necessary to make some changes on a sub-production instance in order to troubleshoot the issue or to test a probable solution. These changes, if any, will be reverted back to the original state. If any change is not reverted a reason will be provided to you. \n \nBest regards, \nMadhukar Regmi \n \nServiceNow Support Team |  Sydney Office ServiceNow | The World Works with ServiceNow\nwork_notes: ********MFR - MEANINGFUL FIRST RESPONSE********\nwork_notes: The blocking task CS6827524 with blocking reason Need Information From Customer is created by Madhukar Regmi (NOW)\ncomments: Hi Madhukar,\n\nI've provided you access to our production instance. Thank you for the help.\n\n\"Also kindly let us know some of the email where they are read and not removed so we can check the records on our end.\"\n\nRegarding the above, any email in the 'Received' inbox after 3:40 PM CST meet that criteria. All emails from then until about 5 PM were manually processed by triggering the Email Reader job, deleting the emails that it read, and repeating those steps until the inbox was cleared. We were forced to delete the emails manually because otherwise, the Email Reader job would not read and process any more emails. However, I will say that it can read new emails if there are a couple of others marked as read, but there seems to be a limit of sorts.\n\nFor the most recent example, though, see the email record linked below. It's the most recent email to come in and is currently still sitting in the Inbox of ServiceCenter@morsco.com, marked as read, but not deleted. \n\nEmail:\nhttps://morsco.service-now.com/sys_email.do?sys_id=dd2e35fd87687590dd34cb3c8bbb35ae&sysparm_view=inbox&sysparm_record_target=sys_email&sysparm_record_row=1&sysparm_record_rows=206&sysparm_record_list=mailbox%3Dreceived%5Esys_created_onONToday%40javascript%3Ags.daysAgoStart%280%29%40javascript%3Ags.daysAgoEnd%280%29%5EORDERBYDESCsys_created_on\n\nLet me know if there are any other details I can provide.\nwork_notes: The blocking task CS6827524 with blocking reason Need Information From Customer is closed by Dylan Huchens\nwork_notes: KB0784213 : Email Sending / Receiving is shown as non-operational in Email Diagnostics Page \nKB0784213 - Email Sending / Receiving is shown as non-operational in Email Diagnostics Page - Perma Link [Public]\nwork_notes: Customer supplied email: https://morsco.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=sys_email.do?sys_id=dd2e35fd87687590dd34cb3c8bbb35ae%26sysparm_view=inbox \n \nAs per the splunk search below: \nhttps://splunk.servicenow.net/en-US/app/search/search?earliest=1691452800&latest=1691798400&q=search%20PH0PR13MB56681EB8BE083ED73D98176FB013A%40PH0PR13MB5668.namprd13.prod.outlook.com&display.page.search.mode=verbose&dispatch.sample_ratio=1&sid=1691635056.35208_2E64B6A5-3172-4185-9C7D-0DCE1FF179CF \n \nThe email was not deleted and when the instance tired to fetch the email it continuously discarded the email and tried to delete it as well.\nwork_notes: CSTASK633425 (Task HOP) has been created\nwork_notes: https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0816001\nwork_notes: KB0816001 : How Emails with Duplicate Message ID's are Handled in ServiceNow \nKB0816001 - How Emails with Duplicate Message ID's are Handled in ServiceNow - Perma Link [Public] \nKB0688478 : Emails Are Not Being Delivered to the ServiceNow Instance via a POP3 or IMAP Microsoft Exchange Email Account \nKB0688478 - Emails Are Not Being Delivered to the ServiceNow Instance via a POP3 or IMAP Microsoft Exchange Email Account - Perma Link [Public]\nwork_notes: Auto close workflow is TRIGGERED for the case.

Also, there is an internal doc that describes some of the shared responsibilities I thought I would post for awareness. \n\"Connectivity from customers to ServiceNow via private exchange such as Equinix involves shared responsibilities. This includes 3rd parties that provide connectivity to Equinix itself. Customers have various methods of connecting to the Equinix backbone in order to peer with ServiceNow and other cloud services. As such ServiceNow cannot maintain sole responsibility for ECX peering's. \nServiceNow continues to recommend that for ECX peering issues customers create cases with Equinix, ServiceNow, and any third parties customers might use for connection to Equinix.\"\nu_technical_action_plan_journal: ********TECHNICAL ACTION PLAN******** \nupdated by Jaba   K k on 17:14 CET on June 2nd, 2023 \n \nISSUE SUMMARY & STATUS: \nNetwork: BGP Peer between customer network and ServiceNow has been dropped (not Service Affecting). \nIssue solved some time ago, discussions with customer are on-going, do not FTS or reassign without checking SAM or EMEA Integrations Leadership \n \nSTEPS TAKEN \n* Jan 25 Customer Raises P2 noting Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) connectivity between DWP, and ServiceNow had failed. Their BGP network interface was showing as 'up', but could not establish a BGP peer connection. \n* Jan 26 CSTASK501623 CNS Backbone (aka Net Eng) \nBGP session drop was caused by issue on ISP network. Issue has been fixed permanently - \"Service is up and stable since 25/01/2023 21:17 GMT\" \n* Feb 1 CSTASK504933 Net Eng There is no cost out involved when a circuit (Colt in this case) physically is not working. There is no mechanism for customer notifications when we observe a circuit go down. These are common occurrences and are the reason for redundant physical connections. \n* Feb 27 Post Case Review for CS6467513  \n.. \nCS determined that DWP's connectivity was affected by their internal network configuration, meaning that the in-place redundancy options were not utilized. As the redundancy options did not auto-resolve, DWP experienced connectivity failure until the issue was resolved at 21:17 (Jan 25). \nPreventative Measures: \nServiceNow recommends that DWP review internal network configurations to avail of all available redundancy as provided by ServiceNow. \n.. \nThe ISP, COLT, experienced a hardware failure at their Newport exchange, disrupting BGP connectivity for DWP. ServiceNow provides three other BGP sessions as a redundancy measure, but DWP traffic could not avail of these, likely due to an internal network configuration. \n.. \n* March 13 Customer notes \"The preventative measure is completely unfeasible and not helpful at all - there is no detail as to what ServiceNow recommend we do.\" \n* May 5 Customer attaches ServiceNowLLDDiagram.pdf noting \"I've attached an overview of our network connectivity - please note that this dedicated connectivity is mirrored for each ServiceNow datacentre.\" \n* May 10 SAM team suggest Technical Support should keep this (Customer network Diagram) on record, under a KB, so that in the event of future network related cases, we have a basis to work on and if we need to engage with our network team, they have this diagram to work from as well. \n* May 11 CSTASK571012  raised for Net Eng to use ServiceNowLLDDiagram.pdf as input to add some detail to Post Case Review (aka RCA)  Preventative Measures to address Customer concerns March 13. \n* Meeting invite sent by Gregson  for May 15 12.00 UK - \"Discuss case CS6467513 BGP Network issues with DWP\". Invitees: Gregson Townsend, James Harland, Nadia Raychinova, David Arzola, Dielle Walker and Tony Barratt. \n* MAY 15: Meeting took place as scheduled. Attendees Gregson Townsend, James Harland, Nadia Raychinova,  Dielle Walker. \nResponse on CSTASK571012 was considered: \n\"Regarding diagram - it does show they have redundant connections in each DC, and in case primary BGP connection (red line) goes down, traffic should be automatically rerouted to blue line. I can't say much if it's the case without seeing at least some config/routing policy on their side.  \nIf they really experienced the issue affecting their traffic when red connection was down, it would be helpful to get analysis  from their side why traffic didn't switch to blue line (and *maybe* we can advise what can be done to fix the issue). \nRegarding support model - same as before, they open case with us in case BGP is down, case is assigned to Network Engineering group and engineer investigate why BGP is down and what (if anything) can be done to fix it. It didn't work well this time (network team was too late with picking up the case), but anyway we wouldn't be able to do much, just update customer, like, ok, 3rd party is down, they are working on bringing it up, but you have redundant connection, use it.\" \nAfter the meeting was concluded, SAM  team passed onto the Customer  the comments on the network diagram from CSTASK571012 and requested further information on the Customer network configuration. \nSAM team committed to creating a KB, intended audience Technical Support teams. KB to contain  Network Diagram to assist with any future Network related issues.  \n*  May 17: Customer responded to SAM Team update of May 15 voicing concerns. \nExample: I (Customer)  have little to no faith that if a BGP peer fails in the future, that ServiceNow will either notify us or treat our cases with the priority that they (Customer) require.  \n* May 22 As per meeting  - Intention is that we will meet with DWP Phil  and Dan + any interested parties on their side + Chris/Olga/Sean/Tech Support +optionally Kavitha Annamaneni (Director, Global Cloud Observability). \nIt was noted during meeting by Chris and Sean that we could  auto-generate Customer-facing cases for ECX or CDC peering, but whether we should seemed unclear. \nEvidently we could  auto-generate Customer-facing cases. If so, this rasies the question what actions could/should be taken by NOW or DWP ie a runbook. \n* May 23: Gregson is liaising with DWP about a meetup between DWP and stakeholders (Sean and Chris for example)  on our side.  \n* May 31st; internal meeting with Chris/Sean/Kavitha Annamaneni (Director, Global Cloud Observability)/Support. It was decided that \n** SN already monitors BGP connections and detects failures \n** There are no plans to create customer facing cases for BGP connection failures \n** There is no special handling notes or a similar process in Datacenter to enter any information about DWP's special configuration \n** Chris provided the following text to be sent to customer if needed, they will also try to join the customer meeting as needed \n\"Connectivity from customers to ServiceNow via private exchange such as Equinix involves shared responsibilities.

Here is what we propose: \n \n1) Regarding monitoring and alerting for BGP routing issues, our customers have various methods for connecting to the Equinix backbone to peer with various cloud services, including ServiceNow. Such connections involve multi-supplier architectures with third party links between said cloud services and Equinix itself, and are designed to be sufficiently redundant. ServiceNow monitors continuously for outages from our end of the network, and our systems alert us internally when we see connections going down.  However, ServiceNow's policy is to not alert our customers when single connections go down; because such single-node alerting would flood our customers with frequent alerts where built-in redundancy should avoid any impact to end-users. We will invite our Network Backbone team to the meeting if you would like to discuss this further. \n \n2) Our Network Engineering is also available if you wish to discuss your routing configuration and the diagram provided (ServiceNowLLDDiagram.pdf) in detail. We can invite our network engineers to this meeting if you would like to discuss the technical details or we can arrange a separate meeting between network teams. \n \n3) If you prefer not to consider any changes to your network, we have already documented this issue internally and engineers who receives similar cases in the future will have instructions to prioritise the case with our Network Engineering so that we can present you with a quick analysis and the next steps to solve the issue. \n \nPlease let me know if you have any questions or when you would like to schedule a call. \n \nBest Regards, \nJaba   K k\nwork_notes: SAM Update: \n \nI have a service review at 10:30 with DWP - so will ask for acknowledgement of the last comments and try to confirm a date for a customer facing call with the NOW SMES\nu_hop_notes: HOP rights have been granted to user: Jabagi Kok (NOW)\ncomments: Dear Dan \n \nThank for your time today and, as discussed, you and Dave Rose have been out of the office for the last 4 days, so you said you will catch up with Dave and you will discuss next steps on how you wish to proceed with this case and discussions we wish to have with you. \n \nKind regards \nGregson\nwork_notes: Needs attention flag is manually unset by Jabagi Kok\nwork_notes: Auto-agent: Case moved to automation user based on rules in \"Case - Awaiting Info - Start\" configuration.\nwork_notes: Recent email from SAM (summarising here with 1 sentence from the email): \n----- \nFrom: Gregson Townsend  \nDate: Friday, 30 June 2023 at 01:41 \nSubject: DWP BGP Network Problems and our customer facing statement \nDWP are still not satisfied with the stance we have taken that if there are future BGP or Network/ISP/Equinix issues, we may not be reporting to DWP about the affected connectivity, even if it did not cause a customer outage. \n----- \nNext actions not specified.\nwork_notes: Recent internal email from SAM \n==== \nFrom: Gregson Townsend  \nDate: Friday, 30 June 2023 at 14:39 \nSubject: Re: DWP BGP Network Problems and our customer facing statement \nMy discussions today with Dan Metcalfe, at DWP, were confirmed that they do not wish their Networks team to talk to ours. Dan said that he knows that their Network team will not accept the invite and that there may not be any profit to any such discussions. \nDan said that the Special Handling Notes we have in place should suffice and he said that DWP staff can guide NOW teams to review the SHN, if it is not being followed, in the event of a network/BGP issue. \nDan will try and meet up with Mark Bell before the meeting with Jordi next week, to let him know of our discussion this morning. \nGregson \n==== \nWill check with customer through this case next Friday if there are no updates by then.\ncomments: Dear customer, \n \nThis is a follow up to a request for additional information.

Because of the nature of the ServiceNow platform, a WAF implementation would be highly complex and might result in blocking legitimate traffic due to the myriad ways ServiceNow instances are used by customers.

After tuning WAF protections to eliminate the negative impacts, the resulting security enhancements were determined to be minimal at best.  Security controls already built into customer instances via the Instance Security Center are available to customers to provide greater protection levels than a ServiceNow managed WAF due to the various use-cases in how customers configure and use their instances. Many of these controls help protect against OWASP Top Ten and other attacks. Additionally, customers have the ability to adopt third-party WAF solutions, such as Cloudflare, if the presence of a WAF is a mandatory requirement.   \n \nAdditionally, The nature of ServiceNow makes it resistant to SQLi as no direct SQL access is allowed to the database and all SQL statements are mediated by the application. ServiceNow also undergoes hundred of penetration tests per year testing for vulnerabilities such as SQL injection as we allow all customers to perform a free penetration test against their sub-production instances annually as well as hire third-party penetration testing companies to perform a penetration test ahead of every major family release.

Also, there is an internal doc that describes some of the shared responsibilities I thought I would post for awareness. \n\"Connectivity from customers to ServiceNow via private exchange such as Equinix involves shared responsibilities. This includes 3rd parties that provide connectivity to Equinix itself. Customers have various methods of connecting to the Equinix backbone in order to peer with ServiceNow and other cloud services. As such ServiceNow cannot maintain sole responsibility for ECX peering's. \nServiceNow continues to recommend that for ECX peering issues customers create cases with Equinix, ServiceNow, and any third parties customers might use for connection to Equinix.\"\nu_technical_action_plan_journal: ********TECHNICAL ACTION PLAN******** \nupdated by Jaba   K k on 17:14 CET on June 2nd, 2023 \n \nISSUE SUMMARY & STATUS: \nNetwork: BGP Peer between customer network and ServiceNow has been dropped (not Service Affecting). \nIssue solved some time ago, discussions with customer are on-going, do not FTS or reassign without checking SAM or EMEA Integrations Leadership \n \nSTEPS TAKEN \n* Jan 25 Customer Raises P2 noting Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) connectivity between DWP, and ServiceNow had failed. Their BGP network interface was showing as 'up', but could not establish a BGP peer connection. \n* Jan 26 CSTASK501623 CNS Backbone (aka Net Eng) \nBGP session drop was caused by issue on ISP network. Issue has been fixed permanently - \"Service is up and stable since 25/01/2023 21:17 GMT\" \n* Feb 1 CSTASK504933 Net Eng There is no cost out involved when a circuit (Colt in this case) physically is not working. There is no mechanism for customer notifications when we observe a circuit go down. These are common occurrences and are the reason for redundant physical connections. \n* Feb 27 Post Case Review for CS6467513  \n.. \nCS determined that DWP's connectivity was affected by their internal network configuration, meaning that the in-place redundancy options were not utilized. As the redundancy options did not auto-resolve, DWP experienced connectivity failure until the issue was resolved at 21:17 (Jan 25). \nPreventative Measures: \nServiceNow recommends that DWP review internal network configurations to avail of all available redundancy as provided by ServiceNow. \n.. \nThe ISP, COLT, experienced a hardware failure at their Newport exchange, disrupting BGP connectivity for DWP. ServiceNow provides three other BGP sessions as a redundancy measure, but DWP traffic could not avail of these, likely due to an internal network configuration. \n.. \n* March 13 Customer notes \"The preventative measure is completely unfeasible and not helpful at all - there is no detail as to what ServiceNow recommend we do.\" \n* May 5 Customer attaches ServiceNowLLDDiagram.pdf noting \"I've attached an overview of our network connectivity - please note that this dedicated connectivity is mirrored for each ServiceNow datacentre.\" \n* May 10 SAM team suggest Technical Support should keep this (Customer network Diagram) on record, under a KB, so that in the event of future network related cases, we have a basis to work on and if we need to engage with our network team, they have this diagram to work from as well. \n* May 11 CSTASK571012  raised for Net Eng to use ServiceNowLLDDiagram.pdf as input to add some detail to Post Case Review (aka RCA)  Preventative Measures to address Customer concerns March 13. \n* Meeting invite sent by Gregson  for May 15 12.00 UK - \"Discuss case CS6467513 BGP Network issues with DWP\". Invitees: Gregson Townsend, James Harland, Nadia Raychinova, David Arzola, Dielle Walker and Tony Barratt. \n* MAY 15: Meeting took place as scheduled. Attendees Gregson Townsend, James Harland, Nadia Raychinova,  Dielle Walker. \nResponse on CSTASK571012 was considered: \n\"Regarding diagram - it does show they have redundant connections in each DC, and in case primary BGP connection (red line) goes down, traffic should be automatically rerouted to blue line. I can't say much if it's the case without seeing at least some config/routing policy on their side.  \nIf they really experienced the issue affecting their traffic when red connection was down, it would be helpful to get analysis  from their side why traffic didn't switch to blue line (and *maybe* we can advise what can be done to fix the issue). \nRegarding support model - same as before, they open case with us in case BGP is down, case is assigned to Network Engineering group and engineer investigate why BGP is down and what (if anything) can be done to fix it. It didn't work well this time (network team was too late with picking up the case), but anyway we wouldn't be able to do much, just update customer, like, ok, 3rd party is down, they are working on bringing it up, but you have redundant connection, use it.\" \nAfter the meeting was concluded, SAM  team passed onto the Customer  the comments on the network diagram from CSTASK571012 and requested further information on the Customer network configuration. \nSAM team committed to creating a KB, intended audience Technical Support teams. KB to contain  Network Diagram to assist with any future Network related issues.  \n*  May 17: Customer responded to SAM Team update of May 15 voicing concerns. \nExample: I (Customer)  have little to no faith that if a BGP peer fails in the future, that ServiceNow will either notify us or treat our cases with the priority that they (Customer) require.  \n* May 22 As per meeting  - Intention is that we will meet with DWP Phil  and Dan + any interested parties on their side + Chris/Olga/Sean/Tech Support +optionally Kavitha Annamaneni (Director, Global Cloud Observability). \nIt was noted during meeting by Chris and Sean that we could  auto-generate Customer-facing cases for ECX or CDC peering, but whether we should seemed unclear. \nEvidently we could  auto-generate Customer-facing cases. If so, this rasies the question what actions could/should be taken by NOW or DWP ie a runbook. \n* May 23: Gregson is liaising with DWP about a meetup between DWP and stakeholders (Sean and Chris for example)  on our side.  \n* May 31st; internal meeting with Chris/Sean/Kavitha Annamaneni (Director, Global Cloud Observability)/Support. It was decided that \n** SN already monitors BGP connections and detects failures \n** There are no plans to create customer facing cases for BGP connection failures \n** There is no special handling notes or a similar process in Datacenter to enter any information about DWP's special configuration \n** Chris provided the following text to be sent to customer if needed, they will also try to join the customer meeting as needed \n\"Connectivity from customers to ServiceNow via private exchange such as Equinix involves shared responsibilities.

Here is what we propose: \n \n1) Regarding monitoring and alerting for BGP routing issues, our customers have various methods for connecting to the Equinix backbone to peer with various cloud services, including ServiceNow. Such connections involve multi-supplier architectures with third party links between said cloud services and Equinix itself, and are designed to be sufficiently redundant. ServiceNow monitors continuously for outages from our end of the network, and our systems alert us internally when we see connections going down.  However, ServiceNow's policy is to not alert our customers when single connections go down; because such single-node alerting would flood our customers with frequent alerts where built-in redundancy should avoid any impact to end-users. We will invite our Network Backbone team to the meeting if you would like to discuss this further. \n \n2) Our Network Engineering is also available if you wish to discuss your routing configuration and the diagram provided (ServiceNowLLDDiagram.pdf) in detail. We can invite our network engineers to this meeting if you would like to discuss the technical details or we can arrange a separate meeting between network teams. \n \n3) If you prefer not to consider any changes to your network, we have already documented this issue internally and engineers who receives similar cases in the future will have instructions to prioritise the case with our Network Engineering so that we can present you with a quick analysis and the next steps to solve the issue. \n \nPlease let me know if you have any questions or when you would like to schedule a call. \n \nBest Regards, \nJaba   K k\nwork_notes: SAM Update: \n \nI have a service review at 10:30 with DWP - so will ask for acknowledgement of the last comments and try to confirm a date for a customer facing call with the NOW SMES\nu_hop_notes: HOP rights have been granted to user: Jabagi Kok (NOW)\ncomments: Dear Dan \n \nThank for your time today and, as discussed, you and Dave Rose have been out of the office for the last 4 days, so you said you will catch up with Dave and you will discuss next steps on how you wish to proceed with this case and discussions we wish to have with you. \n \nKind regards \nGregson\nwork_notes: Needs attention flag is manually unset by Jabagi Kok\nwork_notes: Auto-agent: Case moved to automation user based on rules in \"Case - Awaiting Info - Start\" configuration.\nwork_notes: Recent email from SAM (summarising here with 1 sentence from the email): \n----- \nFrom: Gregson Townsend  \nDate: Friday, 30 June 2023 at 01:41 \nSubject: DWP BGP Network Problems and our customer facing statement \nDWP are still not satisfied with the stance we have taken that if there are future BGP or Network/ISP/Equinix issues, we may not be reporting to DWP about the affected connectivity, even if it did not cause a customer outage. \n----- \nNext actions not specified.\nwork_notes: Recent internal email from SAM \n==== \nFrom: Gregson Townsend  \nDate: Friday, 30 June 2023 at 14:39 \nSubject: Re: DWP BGP Network Problems and our customer facing statement \nMy discussions today with Dan Metcalfe, at DWP, were confirmed that they do not wish their Networks team to talk to ours.

The results you are seeing are expected. Between the different datasources of Service Graph Connectors and our Discovery product, and how the data is collected and in turn transformed is expected to be different for these software models associated to the OS builds you are seeing in excess to what Discovery is using. \n \nIn the interim, if the excess models are causing reporting issues, we would recommend that you use the reconciliation rules to pick a \"source of truth\" between the datasources, and only authorize that datasource to update the respective attributes for the OS install. \n \nThe original design of the multi-source CMDB with Discovery and CMDB in use together was that the Software Asset Management plugin will be indifferent on the differences in the software models due to the fact that they should all be normalizing to the same normalized together in a asset software licensing sense.  \n \n We are aware of these discrepancies of the values and our internal teams have been evaluating if we plan on normalizing all of these; and if so when. We will relay any relevant information/timeline.  \n \n- Please let us know if you would like to discuss any of what was provided, and we will get a meeting scheduled. \n \nRegards, \nSean\ncomments: Hello Dakota, \n \nI miss typed the first sentence in the 3rd paragraph.

I don't think I mentioned SAM either. \n \nOur concerns are about the variation in Operating System values from Tanium Asset SGC (the \"os\" field on \"cmdb_ci_computer\" table). Our concern is if we run Tanium Asset SGC, it will fill in Operating System with values that are not consistent with Discovery or other Service Graph Connectors. \n \nWe have IRE in place and have a great deal of experience with it. I even have a knowledge article I wrote for our users that explains our reconciliation definitions (basically the order of \"precedence\" for each Discovery Source) \nhttps://pdsm.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB000224310 \n \nThe Operating System field is a very important field for reporting and CMDB processes. We use \"Linux Red Hat\" specifically for Linux Patch Status calculation (use Operating System + OS Version + Kernel Release to populate a custom Patch Status field). We only calculate for Linux Red Hat, no other Linux variants. \nTanium seems to be bringing in an entirely new set of operating systems unlike anything we have seen before, and it would cause disruption for reporting and Linux Patch Status calculation (at least) if Tanium started updating Operating System on devices where the highest priority Discovery Source is Tanium. \nPlease look at my text from 2023-05-22 and notice how incredibly different Tanium would be providing Operating System for Linux devices. ServiceNow Discovery just puts \"Linux Red Hat\" (as long as it is actually red hat) and lets the numbers go into OS Version. \n \nIf we place Tanium Asset SGC higher priority over other sources (which would be consistent with how we have treated SCCM SGC and Intune SGC) it could take ownership of that field for a lot of CIs and drastically change the data landscape for Operating System. Even if we put it with the same priority we put to our existing custom Tanium integration, it would still be disruptive due to how different the Operating System data is.\nwork_notes: Moved to Sean who is working on the case.\nu_hop_notes: HOP rights have been granted to user: Catherine Isaacs (NOW)\nu_hop_notes: HOP rights have been granted to user: Sean Webster (NOW)\nwork_notes: Assigned To Changed.\nSpecial Handling Notes:\n\nDO NOT RECORD ZOOM MEETINGS!DO NOT RECORD ZOOM MEETINGS! \nFedEx requires Legal approval in order to have any Customer Support Zoom meetings recorded.

We will relay any relevant information/timeline. \n \n- Please let us know if you would like to discuss any of what was provided, and we will get a meeting scheduled. \n \n******* 7/12 Awaiting on SWARM task update.  \n \n \nNEXT STEPS: \nChecking CSTASK579542  \n\nwork_notes: Auto-agent: Case moved to automation user based on rules in \"Case - Need task completion - Start\" configuration.\nwork_notes: CSTASK579542 (CS - Integrations) Task notes  updated by now.autoagent\n\nAuto-agent: This is an automated reminder that this task is pending your update.

It is updating the OS to a new value as seen in attached screenshot.  \n \nOS value is derived by below SG-Tanium operation. You can see that it takes \"operating_system\" as input and outputs \"u_converted_operating_system\" through the \"Cleanse Operating System\" operation. \n \nhttps://fedexdev01.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=sn_cmdb_int_util_cleanse_os_operation.do?sys_id=daa9a5fa532830106747ddeeff7b1236 \nhttps://fedexdev01.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=sys_rte_eb_operation_type.do?sys_id=02586738735500102b6265a751ab9e63 \n \nThe source data has operating_system as \"Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 7.9 (Maipo)\" and this operation returns the cleansed operating system as \"Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 7.9 (Maipo)\" and that directly goes to the OS field on the CI.  \n \nIf you trace the script you will arrive at below code which is checking if the operating_system passed to it exists in sys_choice or not. When it does not find one it insert one and when it finds one it reuses it.  \n \nhttps://fedexdev01.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=sys_script_include.do?sys_id=5107787137203000dcd48c00dfbe5da7 \n \nSG-Tanium should send \"Linux Red Hat\" instead of \"Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 7.9 (Maipo)\". Looks like other discovery sources send it as \"Linux Red Hat\" and it works for them. Customer needs to work with Tanium on this.\n\n\nwork_notes: State for CSTASK579542 (CS - Integrations) changed to Closed\nwork_notes: The blocking task CSTASK579542 with blocking reason Need Task Completion is closed by Venkatesh Parkala Shenoy (NOW)\nwork_notes: GQM Note: @Piotr Dziarmaga (NOW) to review the task update and follow up.

I would like to confirm the following is correct for the issue you are currently facing:  \n \n \nCASE SUMMARY: \nEmail Reader is slow and is not processing as per expectation. \n \nIssue: \nSlow email reader. \n \nBusiness Impact:  \nInbound email processing \n \nSteps to Reproduce:    \nSend emails to the instance. \n \nInvestigation Summary:    \n- Mailbox is configured via OAuth, connecting to Azure AD \n- Both connection methods were still valid and reporting a successful connection (IMAP and SMTP) \n \nSNC access required: Please provide SNC access to 'madhukar.regmi'. \n \nNext Steps:   \nKindly provide SNC access to the instance to user id 'madhukar.regmi'. Please create a fresh record for this. \nAlso kindly let us know some of the email where they are read and not removed so we can check the records on our end. \n \n*** \nIf you need immediate assistance, please use one of the contact numbers from our support contact page: \nhttp://www.servicenow.com/support/contact-support.htmlYou will then be able to enter your Incident or Change number over the phone to have your call routed to the engineer that owns that Incident or Change. \n \nAs part of the troubleshooting process, I and other ServiceNow personnel may need to access your instance(s) in order to review the service impact to your instance(s) and to determine the root cause. It may also be necessary to make some changes on a sub-production instance in order to troubleshoot the issue or to test a probable solution. These changes, if any, will be reverted back to the original state. If any change is not reverted a reason will be provided to you. \n \nBest regards, \nMadhukar Regmi \n \nServiceNow Support Team |  Sydney Office ServiceNow | The World Works with ServiceNow\nwork_notes: The blocking task CS6827524 with blocking reason Need Information From Customer is created by Madhukar Regmi (NOW)\ncomments: Hi Madhukar,\n\nI've provided you access to our production instance. Thank you for the help.\n\n\"Also kindly let us know some of the email where they are read and not removed so we can check the records on our end.\"\n\nRegarding the above, any email in the 'Received' inbox after 3:40 PM CST meet that criteria. All emails from then until about 5 PM were manually processed by triggering the Email Reader job, deleting the emails that it read, and repeating those steps until the inbox was cleared. We were forced to delete the emails manually because otherwise, the Email Reader job would not read and process any more emails. However, I will say that it can read new emails if there are a couple of others marked as read, but there seems to be a limit of sorts.\n\nFor the most recent example, though, see the email record linked below. It's the most recent email to come in and is currently still sitting in the Inbox of ServiceCenter@morsco.com, marked as read, but not deleted. \n\nEmail:\nhttps://morsco.service-now.com/sys_email.do?sys_id=dd2e35fd87687590dd34cb3c8bbb35ae&sysparm_view=inbox&sysparm_record_target=sys_email&sysparm_record_row=1&sysparm_record_rows=206&sysparm_record_list=mailbox%3Dreceived%5Esys_created_onONToday%40javascript%3Ags.daysAgoStart%280%29%40javascript%3Ags.daysAgoEnd%280%29%5EORDERBYDESCsys_created_on\n\nLet me know if there are any other details I can provide.\nwork_notes: The blocking task CS6827524 with blocking reason Need Information From Customer is closed by Dylan Huchens\nwork_notes: KB0784213 : Email Sending / Receiving is shown as non-operational in Email Diagnostics Page \nKB0784213 - Email Sending / Receiving is shown as non-operational in Email Diagnostics Page - Perma Link [Public]\nwork_notes: Customer supplied email: https://morsco.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=sys_email.do?sys_id=dd2e35fd87687590dd34cb3c8bbb35ae%26sysparm_view=inbox \n \nAs per the splunk search below: \nhttps://splunk.servicenow.net/en-US/app/search/search?earliest=1691452800&latest=1691798400&q=search%20PH0PR13MB56681EB8BE083ED73D98176FB013A%40PH0PR13MB5668.namprd13.prod.outlook.com&display.page.search.mode=verbose&dispatch.sample_ratio=1&sid=1691635056.35208_2E64B6A5-3172-4185-9C7D-0DCE1FF179CF \n \nThe email was not deleted and when the instance tired to fetch the email it continuously discarded the email and tried to delete it as well.\nwork_notes: CSTASK633425 (Task HOP) has been created\nwork_notes: https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0816001\nwork_notes: KB0816001 : How Emails with Duplicate Message ID's are Handled in ServiceNow \nKB0816001 - How Emails with Duplicate Message ID's are Handled in ServiceNow - Perma Link [Public] \nKB0688478 : Emails Are Not Being Delivered to the ServiceNow Instance via a POP3 or IMAP Microsoft Exchange Email Account \nKB0688478 - Emails Are Not Being Delivered to the ServiceNow Instance via a POP3 or IMAP Microsoft Exchange Email Account - Perma Link [Public]\nwork_notes: Auto close workflow is TRIGGERED for the case.

Please create a fresh record for this. \nAlso kindly let us know some of the email where they are read and not removed so we can check the records on our end. \n \n*** \nIf you need immediate assistance, please use one of the contact numbers from our support contact page: \nhttp://www.servicenow.com/support/contact-support.htmlYou will then be able to enter your Incident or Change number over the phone to have your call routed to the engineer that owns that Incident or Change. \n \nAs part of the troubleshooting process, I and other ServiceNow personnel may need to access your instance(s) in order to review the service impact to your instance(s) and to determine the root cause. It may also be necessary to make some changes on a sub-production instance in order to troubleshoot the issue or to test a probable solution.

Thank you for the help.\n\n\"Also kindly let us know some of the email where they are read and not removed so we can check the records on our end.\"\n\nRegarding the above, any email in the 'Received' inbox after 3:40 PM CST meet that criteria. All emails from then until about 5 PM were manually processed by triggering the Email Reader job, deleting the emails that it read, and repeating those steps until the inbox was cleared. We were forced to delete the emails manually because otherwise, the Email Reader job would not read and process any more emails. However, I will say that it can read new emails if there are a couple of others marked as read, but there seems to be a limit of sorts.\n\nFor the most recent example, though, see the email record linked below. It's the most recent email to come in and is currently still sitting in the Inbox of ServiceCenter@morsco.com, marked as read, but not deleted. \n\nEmail:\nhttps://morsco.service-now.com/sys_email.do?sys_id=dd2e35fd87687590dd34cb3c8bbb35ae&sysparm_view=inbox&sysparm_record_target=sys_email&sysparm_record_row=1&sysparm_record_rows=206&sysparm_record_list=mailbox%3Dreceived%5Esys_created_onONToday%40javascript%3Ags.daysAgoStart%280%29%40javascript%3Ags.daysAgoEnd%280%29%5EORDERBYDESCsys_created_on\n\nLet me know if there are any other details I can provide.\nwork_notes: The blocking task CS6827524 with blocking reason Need Information From Customer is closed by Dylan Huchens\nwork_notes: KB0784213 : Email Sending / Receiving is shown as non-operational in Email Diagnostics Page \nKB0784213 - Email Sending / Receiving is shown as non-operational in Email Diagnostics Page - Perma Link [Public]\nwork_notes: Customer supplied email: https://morsco.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=sys_email.do?sys_id=dd2e35fd87687590dd34cb3c8bbb35ae%26sysparm_view=inbox \n \nAs per the splunk search below: \nhttps://splunk.servicenow.net/en-US/app/search/search?earliest=1691452800&latest=1691798400&q=search%20PH0PR13MB56681EB8BE083ED73D98176FB013A%40PH0PR13MB5668.namprd13.prod.outlook.com&display.page.search.mode=verbose&dispatch.sample_ratio=1&sid=1691635056.35208_2E64B6A5-3172-4185-9C7D-0DCE1FF179CF \n \nThe email was not deleted and when the instance tired to fetch the email it continuously discarded the email and tried to delete it as well.\nwork_notes: CSTASK633425 (Task HOP) has been created\nwork_notes: https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0816001\nwork_notes: KB0816001 : How Emails with Duplicate Message ID's are Handled in ServiceNow \nKB0816001 - How Emails with Duplicate Message ID's are Handled in ServiceNow - Perma Link [Public] \nKB0688478 : Emails Are Not Being Delivered to the ServiceNow Instance via a POP3 or IMAP Microsoft Exchange Email Account \nKB0688478 - Emails Are Not Being Delivered to the ServiceNow Instance via a POP3 or IMAP Microsoft Exchange Email Account - Perma Link [Public]\nwork_notes: Needs attention flag is manually unset by Madhukar Regmi<|end|>\n<|user|>\nFrom the above document.

Thank you for the help.\n\n\"Also kindly let us know some of the email where they are read and not removed so we can check the records on our end.\"\n\nRegarding the above, any email in the 'Received' inbox after 3:40 PM CST meet that criteria. All emails from then until about 5 PM were manually processed by triggering the Email Reader job, deleting the emails that it read, and repeating those steps until the inbox was cleared. We were forced to delete the emails manually because otherwise, the Email Reader job would not read and process any more emails. However, I will say that it can read new emails if there are a couple of others marked as read, but there seems to be a limit of sorts.\n\nFor the most recent example, though, see the email record linked below.

Many hosting providers offer WAF capabilities as well. - URL:https://community.orbussoftware.com/community \n \n  Web Application Firewall (WAF) is not currently in place given the nature of the ServiceNow platform architecture. Because of the nature of the ServiceNow platform, a WAF implementation would be highly complex and might result in blocking legitimate traffic due to the myriad ways ServiceNow instances are used by customers. In the absence of a WAF, ServiceNow has implemented compensating controls that customers can manage within their instance. \n \nServiceNow has performed significant testing using WAF capabilities across the platform that resulted in severe performance and availability impacts to instances. After tuning WAF protections to eliminate the negative impacts, the resulting security enhancements were determined to be minimal at best. Security controls already built into customer instances via the Instance Security Center are available to customers to provide greater protection levels than a ServiceNow-managed WAF due to the various use cases in how customers configure and use their instances. Many of these controls help protect against OWASP Top Ten and other attacks. Additionally, customers have the ability to adopt third-party WAF solutions, such as Cloudflare, if the presence of a WAF is a mandatory requirement. \n \n2) Website does not implement X-XSS-Protection Best Practices - Add the following header to responses from this website: 'X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block' - URL:https://community.orbussoftware.com/community \n \n  Due to the customizability of the platform, ServiceNow has decided not to implement the X-XSS protection header out of the box and instead relies on other mitigations for XSS protection. ServiceNow allows customers to extend the platform in numerous ways that could be impacted by setting this header out of the box. ServiceNow performs input validation in the form of input escaping and output encoding for JS, HTML, NG and Jelly technologies. A combinational approach is used based on the usage and nature of the data being consumed by the application. The platform has configurations in the form of system properties that controls the security behaviour for Input Validations and Database operations. You can find these configurations via ServiceNow Instance Hardening. Specifically, information about the HTML Sanitizer can be found here: https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=c_HTMLSanitizer.html&version=platform. \n \nFor more information on this please see the following resources \n- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-XSS-Protection \n- https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/HTTP_Headers_Cheat_Sheet.html \n \n3) Content Security Policy Contains Broad Directives - Explicitly specify trusted sources for your script-src and object-src policies.

As such ServiceNow does not set this header out of the box. \n  \nIf your security team feels this header is necessary to be set, your instance administrators can configure HTTP response headers for all, or specific types of pages, which include Service Portal, UI Page, or UX applications.

I don't think I mentioned SAM either. \n \nOur concerns are about the variation in Operating System values from Tanium Asset SGC (the \"os\" field on \"cmdb_ci_computer\" table). Our concern is if we run Tanium Asset SGC, it will fill in Operating System with values that are not consistent with Discovery or other Service Graph Connectors. \n \nWe have IRE in place and have a great deal of experience with it. I even have a knowledge article I wrote for our users that explains our reconciliation definitions (basically the order of \"precedence\" for each Discovery Source) \nhttps://pdsm.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB000224310 \n \nThe Operating System field is a very important field for reporting and CMDB processes. We use \"Linux Red Hat\" specifically for Linux Patch Status calculation (use Operating System + OS Version + Kernel Release to populate a custom Patch Status field). We only calculate for Linux Red Hat, no other Linux variants. \nTanium seems to be bringing in an entirely new set of operating systems unlike anything we have seen before, and it would cause disruption for reporting and Linux Patch Status calculation (at least) if Tanium started updating Operating System on devices where the highest priority Discovery Source is Tanium. \nPlease look at my text from 2023-05-22 and notice how incredibly different Tanium would be providing Operating System for Linux devices. ServiceNow Discovery just puts \"Linux Red Hat\" (as long as it is actually red hat) and lets the numbers go into OS Version. \n \nIf we place Tanium Asset SGC higher priority over other sources (which would be consistent with how we have treated SCCM SGC and Intune SGC) it could take ownership of that field for a lot of CIs and drastically change the data landscape for Operating System. Even if we put it with the same priority we put to our existing custom Tanium integration, it would still be disruptive due to how different the Operating System data is.\n\n\nwork_notes: Auto-agent: Case moved to automation user based on rules in \"Case - Need task completion - Start\" configuration.\nwork_notes: CSTASK579542 (CS - Integrations) Task notes  updated by now.autoagent\n\nAuto-agent: This is an automated reminder that this task is pending your update.

My name is Jackie, and I will assist you with your case. I would like to confirm the following is correct:  \n \nAssistance Requested:  \nYou would like to check why the temp instance provided to restore the DEV instance does not restore the certificate. \n \nBusiness Impact:  __FOR_P2_REQUEST_IT_IF_NOT_PROVIDED_BY_CUSTOMER__  \n The instance copy may have taken a backup with no data in the sys_certificate table. \n \nSteps to Reproduce:    \nThank you for bringing this to our attention. After checking, the instance copy may have taken a backup with no data in the sys_certificate table. Please could you confirm on when the time the table was populated? We could then proceed with another Instance Copy to check the content of that table (ideally from the latest backup) if the table is populated now. \n \nLook forward to hearing from you shortly. \n \nAs part of the troubleshooting process, I and other ServiceNow personnel may need to access your instance(s) in order to review the service impact to your instance and determine the root cause. It may also be necessary to make some changes on a sub-production instance in order to troubleshoot the issue or to test a probable solution. These changes, if any, will be reverted back to the original state. If any change is not reverted a reason will be provided for the same. \n \n \nBest Regards, \nJackie Cheung \nServiceNow Customer Support\nwork_notes: CSTASK607832 (Instance Automation) Task notes

If yes, what would be the best practice configuration or any other advice, which we could take in the account before proceeding with MySQL 8.\n\nPlease pass this case to SHOT Team for them to have a look and advise.\nwork_notes: Affected Instances were changed.\nSpecial Handling Notes:\n\nSpecial Handling Notes || Danske Bank ASDanske Bank is not allowed to use Zoom and for all interaction with NOW support cases & needs to be through MS Teams\nwork_notes: Special Handling Notes:\n\nUse MS Teams onlyAs per cooperate policy Danske Bank is not allowed to use Zoom and therefore all support interactions should be done using MS Teams.Special Handling Notes || Danske Bank ASDanske Bank is not allowed to use Zoom and for all interaction with NOW support cases & needs to be through MS TeamsOn-PremThis customer has Self-Hosted instances, but may also have instances hosted in the ServiceNow cloud.

This is impacting users ability to do their normal work activities without having to perform frequent browser page refreshes.\nActions taken: ServiceNow has reconvened on the 10:00 ET June 23rd scheduled MS Teams bridge call with your team and Netskope vendor for troubleshooting the network connection issues seen between Netskope and ServiceNow from the packet captures that were provided. You have agreed on the call, that since your team implemented a bypass of the Netskope proxy on the 'discover' production instance to your bluecoat proxy as a workaround as of 19:27 US/Central on July 22, the issue is no longer being observed during your current peak business hours today, June 23, and temporary relief can be declared while root cause investigations continue. \nPreviously, the IPS setting was briefly re-enabled before the workaround was implemented in order to allow Netskope to perform packet captures with the network traffic having the '502' error. In parallel ServiceNow performed packet captures which were provided to Netskope for their analysis. We observed that when the Netskope client was disabled on a computer, users no longer experienced the '502' error messages. Your team had advised us that a Netskope Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) setting was enabled about an hour before you noticed HTTP traffic began to increase and you started to experience the '502' errors this past Friday, June 16th.\nMost Probable Cause: The most probable cause is suspected to be due to network connection errors between Netskope and ServiceNow since the Netskope Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) setting was enabled on Friday, June 16th with a large increase in the volume of active network connection sessions. However, we are continuing to investigate. \n \nNext steps: This case has been moved to a state of Temporary Relief as the issue is no longer impacting users during peak hours since your team implemented the workaround to bypass the Netskope proxy.  ServiceNow is continuing to troubleshoot with your team and Netskope the network connections packet captures to establish the root cause and propose a permanent solution to fix/resolve this issue.

Thank you for the help.\n\n\"Also kindly let us know some of the email where they are read and not removed so we can check the records on our end.\"\n\nRegarding the above, any email in the 'Received' inbox after 3:40 PM CST meet that criteria. All emails from then until about 5 PM were manually processed by triggering the Email Reader job, deleting the emails that it read, and repeating those steps until the inbox was cleared. We were forced to delete the emails manually because otherwise, the Email Reader job would not read and process any more emails. However, I will say that it can read new emails if there are a couple of others marked as read, but there seems to be a limit of sorts.\n\nFor the most recent example, though, see the email record linked below. It's the most recent email to come in and is currently still sitting in the Inbox of ServiceCenter@morsco.com, marked as read, but not deleted. \n\nEmail:\nhttps://morsco.service-now.com/sys_email.do?sys_id=dd2e35fd87687590dd34cb3c8bbb35ae&sysparm_view=inbox&sysparm_record_target=sys_email&sysparm_record_row=1&sysparm_record_rows=206&sysparm_record_list=mailbox%3Dreceived%5Esys_created_onONToday%40javascript%3Ags.daysAgoStart%280%29%40javascript%3Ags.daysAgoEnd%280%29%5EORDERBYDESCsys_created_on\n\nLet me know if there are any other details I can provide.\nwork_notes: The blocking task CS6827524 with blocking reason Need Information From Customer is closed by Dylan Huchens\nwork_notes: KB0784213 : Email Sending / Receiving is shown as non-operational in Email Diagnostics Page \nKB0784213 - Email Sending / Receiving is shown as non-operational in Email Diagnostics Page - Perma Link [Public]\nwork_notes: Customer supplied email: https://morsco.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=sys_email.do?sys_id=dd2e35fd87687590dd34cb3c8bbb35ae%26sysparm_view=inbox \n \nAs per the splunk search below: \nhttps://splunk.servicenow.net/en-US/app/search/search?earliest=1691452800&latest=1691798400&q=search%20PH0PR13MB56681EB8BE083ED73D98176FB013A%40PH0PR13MB5668.namprd13.prod.outlook.com&display.page.search.mode=verbose&dispatch.sample_ratio=1&sid=1691635056.35208_2E64B6A5-3172-4185-9C7D-0DCE1FF179CF \n \nThe email was not deleted and when the instance tired to fetch the email it continuously discarded the email and tried to delete it as well.\nwork_notes: CSTASK633425 (Task HOP) has been created\nwork_notes: https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0816001\nwork_notes: KB0816001 : How Emails with Duplicate Message ID's are Handled in ServiceNow \nKB0816001 - How Emails with Duplicate Message ID's are Handled in ServiceNow - Perma Link [Public] \nKB0688478 : Emails Are Not Being Delivered to the ServiceNow Instance via a POP3 or IMAP Microsoft Exchange Email Account \nKB0688478 - Emails Are Not Being Delivered to the ServiceNow Instance via a POP3 or IMAP Microsoft Exchange Email Account - Perma Link [Public]\nwork_notes: Needs attention flag is manually unset by Madhukar Regmi\nwork_notes: Auto close workflow is TRIGGERED for the case.
