We tried earlier to move that customer, Annie Turcios from one household (accidentally created) to another. I informed that at this point of time customers cannot be directly shifted from one household to another. Customers that need to be shifted must first be split from their current household and then combined into their new household. We kind of did that, but inadvertently another member was shifted Aflec Velazquez/Velasquez (we have to check on how to spell his surname which was also updated). Shifting Aflec was ok, because they need to be under the same household anyways. Just to confirm the household is now currently set up in Aflec Velazquez's name with Annie Turcios listed as a member. Note that I did see Annie listed twice as a person in Apex, and each Annie shows as a member in two households... I want her to stay under Aflec, so combined the two, but csr could not do that (one was policy the other was a quote) but then when I had the agency on hold to review knowledge documents, they tried to do something similar with the children that needed to come over to Aflec Velazquez's household and now the children are on their own household, listed as members.

NewLearning would respond with a 403 error message using credentials aapple@xinfam.com as there is no such profile.  NewLearning is fed data from Workday thus all this information must be aligned for the email to function.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[cid:image014.jpg@01D76203.CB82F460]Aron W. van | Learning and Development\n388 S.

Please let me know if you will be the best contact, or if I should work with IT.\n\nIf I click on NewLearning in the home Okta it takes me to Compass. If I click on My Learning again from here it will refresh back into Compass. I tried logging into only Compass and then clicking on the link to NewLearning and it does the same thing and refreshes the page.\n\nI spoke with IT earlier this week and found out I should be using the Okta email of aapple@xinfam.com. Could this be what is causing the problem?\n\nThank you,\nAlice\n\n\n\n[cid:image015.jpg@01D76203.CB82F460]Alice Webb | Human Resources\n388 S.
