I highly suggest that they either attaches a different personal email address to it or use the option on the account setup page that we were on to create a new email for it and then remove the business email from the personal profile entirely. I have seen this kind of set up cause nothing but problems. Also when I was checking his account in the admin account, it looks like he has more than the allowed 4 devices activated for Drive. I would check with the user to see if some of those can be removed. \n  \n Another thing I noticed was how your team had the separate account for Drive. Is that where users store shared files? I would suggest, instead of doing that, migrating those files into Drive. It will surely make the management and sharing of those files easier. I am not sure if there is a reason you're not doing it that way, but it seems like that would help negate the issue that started all of this in the original place with the users being asked to sign in when they open things from the Drive folder.\ncomments: Hello Mike,\n\nI have got the access to delete this personal profile.

MyLearning would respond with a 403 error message using credentials aapple@amfam.com as there is no such profile.

Please let me know if you will be the best contact, or if I should work with IT.\n\nIf I click on MyLearning in the Homesite Okta it takes me to Compass. If I click on My Learning again from here it will refresh back into Compass. I tried logging into only Compass and then clicking on the link to MyLearning and it does the same thing and refreshes the page.\n\nI spoke with IT earlier this week and found out I should be using the Okta email of aapple@amfam.com.

We tried earlier to move that customer, Annie Turcios from one household (accidentally created) to another. I informed that at this point of time customers cannot be directly shifted from one household to another. Customers that need to be shifted must first be split from their current household and then combined into their new household. We kind of did that, but inadvertently another member was shifted Aflec Velazquez/Velasquez (we have to check on how to spell his surname which was also updated). Shifting Aflec was ok, because they need to be under the same household anyways. Just to confirm the household is now currently set up in Aflec Velazquez's name with Annie Turcios listed as a member. Note that I did see Annie listed twice as a person in Apex, and each Annie shows as a member in two households... I want her to stay under Aflec, so combined the two, but csr could not do that (one was policy the other was a quote) but then when I had the agency on hold to review knowledge documents, they tried to do something similar with the children that needed to come over to Aflec Velazquez's household and now the children are on their own household, listed as members.

Until the mobile number available for her Milwaukee office comes, can we delete her mobile from the website and use the Menomonee Falls mobile number for both locations? Only until the Milwaukee number is available, and at that time, add that to the Milwaukee location \n2. Second, her Menomonee Falls address needs to be updated to the PRIMARY location, how can we do this? Is there an e-form that needs to be submitted? \n3. Third, the book of business she is set to receive is \"banked\" with the storefront location, if possible we need to transfer that book to Maria on September 24th, should I do the book transfer e-form as it is banked with the storefront or does someone at the storefront need to complete it? \n4. How do we remove the voicemail from the prior agent associated with the Menomonee Falls mobile number so that Maria can set up her mobile system accordingly? \n5. How do we allign the correct staff with each location on the agent website? Is that something that Maria is able to do?\n\nThank you so much for your help!\n\n\nThanks,\n\nAmit Bruner\n\nState: Closed\n\nwork_notes: KANDREW2@ameam.com 09/20/2021 16:15:06\nHi Amit,\nThanks for your email. \nI've made the Menomonee office primary and added that mobile number to the Milwaukee office in place of Maria's mobile. \nIf her mobiles are on Agency Connect, she can contact them for help with the voicemail update: ameamagencyconnect@ameam.com or x31121\nFAST would be able to assist on this with the question about assigning staff to the correct location on an agent website. They can be reached at FAST@ameam.com or x78017.\n\nRegarding banked agency, if you can tell me who the terminated agent was, I'll connect you with the specialist who's handling distribution of the banked policies.\nThanks!\nKam\n\n\n\n<|end|>\n<|user|>\nIn the context of a case, the resolution notes section is where the agent records information about the resolution of the case.

I need further assistance.\n\n\ncomments: \nHi John, \n\nFirstly congratulations on the arrival of your little one - I hope everyone is doing well! \n\nPlease can I kindly recommend having a look at the KB0053809 : UK Benefits Portal Guide knowledge article which confirms:\n\nWhen can I add or change my dependents?\n-  You can add or remove dependents to your cover during the annual enrolment window, which occurs in November each year. \n-  You can also apply to make a change to your cover if your personal circumstances change. This is called a lifestyle event and broadly includes things like births, marriage, deaths, etc. You can apply for a lifestyle event by navigating to the person icon in the top right corner of the benefits portal and selecting \"change in circumstance\"\n** Please note; when you add dependents to your benefits portal, they do not automatically add to the policies, the dependants must be added manually by yourself. \n\nYou will need to submit a lifestyle event to add your son to your policies.  You can do this by going to the ServiceNow Benefits portal and submitting a 'Change in Circumstance' (see screenshot attached for where you can find this).  Once this has been submitted, it will go through for approval and once approved you will be given a window where you can go in and add your son to your policies.  \n\nOnce your lifestlye event has been approved and you have received the window to make changes, go to the ServiceNow Benefits portal, click the benefit you wish to add him to e.g. 'Private Medical Insurance' > click 'View' > click 'Add a dependant' > Select your son > Submit and repeat for any other policies as nrequired. \n \nI will now close out your case but please feel free to reopen and let me know if you require any further support.\n \nHave a great rest of your day!\nHR Agent \n \nPlease note, you will receive a survey to complete regarding your HR Case experience with the Global Talent team and would be grateful if you could provide your feedback. Thank you in advance for your time!   \n\n\nwork_notes: \nAttachment Added.

As you see from the screenshots I shared previously, I've done those steps by adding my son as a dependant. However, the window seems not open so I can't add him into my medical and dental insurances. When I add him as a dependant I remember the window was given this week but somehow I can't go and confirm the date. So could you tell me when is the next window that I can make the required changes? \n\nThanks\n\n\ncomments: \nHi John,\n\nGreat, thank you for confirming you were able to add your son. \n\nI have just had a look in the back end of the system and can see you have updated your medical and dental from couple cover to family cover and your son, Torin Doe has been added as a dependant to both policies which will be effective 01/06/2023.\n\nI will now close your case but any further questions, please let me know.\n\nThanks! \nHR Agent\n\n\nwork_notes: Case reopened by Service-now: Rohan Babli [maint,admin,itil]\n\n\n<|end|>\n<|user|>\nIn the context of a case, the resolution notes section is where the agent records information about the resolution of the case.

They explained that the exclusions won't apply in a manual scan. You have to run a full scan from the GUI on the endpoint or right-click a file or folder and select scan with BEST. This said, scheduled scans will apply the exclusions. It comprises Full Scans, Network Scans, and Custom Scans. The Device scan should apply the exclusions if a scheduled scan is run. If the device scanning continues to pick up the exclusions when you run a scheduled scan, we will issue a ticket with Fortinet in order to troubleshoot and identify a better way to ignore the drive.\ncomments: Thanks Heather,\n\nThis issue with device scans not applying the custom exclusions has already been observed, and the logs account for that. The users are not running manual scans, I know that. Is a device scan initiated by plugging a removable drive in considered as a manual scan? Maybe that's why the cloud storage isn t being ignored in this case?\n\nRegards,\nMark\n\n[1]\n\nMark Hazimov\nTechnician\n\nData Consulting Group\n1456 Union Drive, Ste Z, San Francisco, CA 94000\nOffice # : (674) 432-8765 x290\n\nFrom: Magna5 Support \nSent: Tuesday, May 09, 2020 10:10\nTo: Bob Wilson ; Mark Hazimov \nSubject: Case MAG0011322 has been updated\ncomments: Yes, it's plausible.

You will receive an email from our Employee Benefits Broker, Schouten Zekerheid, containing a video link that will provide you with details of our benefits plans and how to enroll in voluntary schemes should you wish to. Alternatively, you can enroll now by clicking here' (link in the knowledge article) and also confirms that if you need help, to contact the broker, Schouten Zekerheid XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXschoutenzekerheid.nl so I would recommend reaching out to the broker to confirm if you already have cover. \n\nIf you have any quesitons on the above, please let me know and if you wanted to CC me in the email to the broker for support I am happy for you to do that. \n\nThanks! \nHR Agent\n\n\nwork_notes: \nHey @Maria Clesham,\nFollowing on from the below, Global Mobility confirmed Benefits would need to advise on the 'social security arrangement' that John refers to - shall I reach out to Celing about this?\nThanks!&nbsp;HR Agent\n\n\ncomments: \nHi HR Agent,\n\nThank you for looking into it. \nWhat you mentioned form the KB does make sense. I wanted to double check I didn't miss anything since I just received the CZ information (last week) and hadn't been made aware there was additional steps for me to take in order to be compliant with local law (except from that Fragomen message I copy/paste below that told me to contact Global Mobility who then redirected me to yet another service). \n\nAt this point, all is clear on my side. I hope I won't be in any kind of trouble for contracting an insurance a few months after relocating due to some gaps in the internal process!  \n\nThanks for your support and your clear answers. \n\nKind regards,\nJohn\n\n\ncomments: \n@HR Agent\nThanks for the information. Both links are working now. \n\nI'm still unsure if I already have an medical insurance or if I need to contract one.\n\n\nwork_notes: \nHey @Maria Clesham,\n\nDo you know if NL employees are automatically enrolled in Health Insurance when they are hired / transferred?  As per the KB0052192 : Employee Benefits - Netherlands KBA it says the below which makes me think they still need to enroll:\n\nNew to ServiceNow? You will receive an email from our Employee Benefits Broker, Schouten Zekerheid, containing a video link that will provide you with details of our benefits plans and how to enroll in voluntary schemes should you wish to. Alternatively, you can enroll now by clicking here. \n\nAre you able to confirm?\n\nThanks! \nHR Agent\n\n\ncomments: \nHi John,\n\nI hope you are doing well & had a great weekend!  \n\nI am not sure I fully understand your question here.  As per the KB0052192 : Employee Benefits - Netherlands knowledge article, it confirms the schemes are voluntary for you to sign up to should you wish but if you are new to ServiceNow (including new to The Netherlands) that you will still need to enroll.  The knowledge article includes links on how to enroll and contact details direct to the broker for questions regarding enrollment.  If I am not understanding correctly, please let me know if you would like to jump on a call to go through in more detail? I have also reached out to my team to clarify so will let you know when I have an update there. \n\nRegarding your relocation query, this would be something that Global Mobility  would be able to advise on as my team and I wouldn't have visibility to any social security arrangement.  I have sent Global Mobility an email with your question and yourself in CC for their guidance on that. \n\nThanks! \nHR Agent\n\n\ncomments: \nHi John,\n\nPlease can I kindly recommend having a look at the KB0052192 : Employee Benefits - Netherlands knowledge article which provides further guidance regarding the Health Insurance as well as contact details to reach out to the brokers directly. \n\nIn addition, the KB0051840 : Benefit Summaries - EMEA knowledge article is back up and running. \n\nI will now close out your case but please feel free to reopen and let me know if you require any further support.\n \nHave a great rest of your day!\nHR Agent \n \nPlease note, you will receive a survey to complete regarding your HR Case experience with the Global Talent team and would be grateful if you could provide your feedback.

I would think that is a ServiceNow question.\n\nWhen I completed my relocation to The Netherlands the company in charge of my transfer (Fragomen) told me to reach out to global mobility about the below.\n\n\"Dear John, \n\nThank you for sending a copy of your registration documents. The process is now complete.\n\n\"Please keep in mind that since you registered with town hall as resident of the Netherlands you are required to obtain Dutch health insurance.

I have informed payroll and as discussed, due to the confirmation coming in after payroll cut off, this will not be captured until February 2023 payroll. \n\nI will now close out your case but please feel free to reopen and let me know if you require any further support.\n \nHave a great rest of your day!\nHR Agent \n \nPlease note, you will receive a survey to complete regarding your HR Case experience with the Global Talent team and would be grateful if you could provide your feedback.

I appreciate your help, as always.\n\nSo to confirm, for 2023 I will have:\n\n  *   37.5 days carried over from 2022\n  *   25 PTO days for 2023\n  *   1 public holiday day carried over from New Years Day 2022\n  *   TOTAL = 63.5 PTO days\n\nAnd then based on my understanding, I will then need to use or loose all of these days, excluding the 5 I can carry over into 2024, is that right? It s going to be quite difficult to take this many days in one year. I d already started thinking about shortening my mat leave and replacing the final weeks with PTO, so I ll need to do this ASAP if I really will lose the holiday days if I m unable to take them.\n\nThanks,\nJohn\n\n\nwork_notes: \n* &nbsp;Processed in WD with comment 'Updating estimated last day of leave to 31/12/2022 as confirmed via HRC0449230' and 'HRC0449230 &amp; HRC0297061'* &nbsp;Payroll Request Raised: &nbsp;FR0261771\n\n\ncomments: \nHi John, \n\nThank you for confirming. I will get this processed and let you know when complete.  \n\nRegarding KIT dates, I received confirmation that these are recorded as 'Other Time Off (Global)' in Workday (in order to generate payment), but they are a working day.  That said, employees aren't eligible for bonus on those days as employees are still on maternity leave during that time (and still recorded as  on leave ).

User Action: Check the cables to the adapter and the Hub or Switch. If no cable problems are found, the adapter, Hub, or Switch may need replacement.\nThis trap will be sent any time the status of a logical adapter changes to the Failed condition.
