Before we look into this with you, can you please give us the following information below:\n\nDo you see this issue with other email clients as well, or only for Cosmetic Index?\n\nWhat Google Email version is this client using?\n\nYou may follow this link below in order to enable logging:\n\nhttps://support.google.com/en-us/workspace/what-is-the-enable-logging-troubleshooting-option-0fdc446d-d1d4-42c7-bd73-475djgjd9797djo\ncomments: Hello,\n\nIt appears to impact Cosmetic Index - Issues observed since Monday\n06/11/2020 - Intermitently\nGoogle email Version 675 2003 (Build 67583.90453)\n\nThe temporary solution yesterday was the following\n1. Change password to make system work / on some systems, the password change temporarily fixed the problem, before the problem came back\n2. Mapi connection of online account was removed, and added again / solves issue\n3. Repair/Reinstall of Google Email (Google Workspace)\n\nWe have some problems again today, so we want to enable logging for your team and check the logs and will update this ticket for your review.\n\nIsmael Maduro\nIntelinet Systems\nwww.intelinetsystems.com\ncomments: This below is a download for the logs from a user's Google Email client in which the issue could be observed today\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/en-us/workspace/information-protection/configure-usage-rights#encrypt-only-option-for-emails\ncomments: These below are the logs from a user's PC where the same issue can be observed\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/fwowuvgqvl984r872adBbj9zqLwhwcwr575/view?usp=sharing\ncomments: Hey Ismael,\nJust a few more things here. First, I would recommend making them logout of their Google Workspace, and then try reconnecting to Workspace and to Google Email client as well. It could fix some password glitches in the system somehow. Next, could you please let us know if you have performed a remote connectivity test via https://testconnectivity.google.com/tests/workspace? This test may help find issues ongoing within the accounts concerned relative to a possible password loop. Lastly, we couldn't view the RAR file that you shared. Could you resubmit the logs as a screenshot or maybe as a text file? We couldn't find the file for download. If none of these suggestions solve the problem, we may call a screenshare during which we will take a closer look at what's happening.\ncomments: Hello, We shared a google drive link with a file for your review and intend to solve this because the customer is still having the same problems\ncomments: Hi Ismael,\nWe tried to open the Google Doc but could not open it, because the log file was saved as a rar file but Google Doc won't open rar files. After the last email, did you continue troubleshooting following the steps provided earlier?\ncomments: Hi All,\n\nJust checking in, hoping all is well. It seems that some additional information was requested before we attempted to proceed. Did you see that request and could you check if anything is different now or is the same issues persist? Let us know how we can be of further help. We will be on the lookout for your reply!\ncomments: We've not received anything from your team. We sent the files in the first half of last week\ncomments: Hi Ismael,\nIt seems that last communication we sent was to say that unfortunately because the file was a rar file we were not able to open it with Google Doc. This issue has prevented us from troubleshooting furter thus far. Could you please re-upload the file as a screenshot or as a file in a different format? Sorry for the inconvenience.\n\nFurther, did you try to have the users logout of their Google Workspace and then reconnect to it, doing the same thing with Google email? It could fix some password glitches in the system somehow. Next, could you please let us know if you have performed a remote connectivity test via https://testconnectivity.google.com/tests/workspace?

Asked for additional information, but partner explained that he is waiting for our input. I responded and mentioned that we still require further details to understand what the problem is.\ncomments: Hi Ismael,\nDo you have any feedback based on the suggestions made earlier by Alan? Could you also resend the file in a different file format?\ncomments: Hi Ismael,\nDo you have any feedback based on the suggestions made earlier by Alan? Could you also resend the file in a different file format?\ncomments: We shared the file again in a different format on 06/19\ncomments: Hi Ismael,\nWe can't find this file in the history of this ticket or as attachment, could you share it again with us?\n\nMany thanks\ncomments: Hi Ismael,\nI did not receive the material you mentioned earlier, can you please share again?\ncomments: Hi Team,\nSince we have not received further communication from you for this issue, could you please let us know if we can go ahead and close this ticket?

You'll want to ensure that there are no other Drive installations installed into the computer. Also ensure that the main account signed in is within the local account. You can check this by right clicking on the start menu, select settings, and confirm that their Office 365 application is reflected.

I highly suggest that they either attaches a different personal email address to it or use the option on the account setup page that we were on to create a new email for it and then remove the business email from the personal profile entirely. I have seen this kind of set up cause nothing but problems. Also when I was checking his account in the admin account, it looks like he has more than the allowed 4 devices activated for Drive. I would check with the user to see if some of those can be removed. \n  \n Another thing I noticed was how your team had the separate account for Drive. Is that where users store shared files? I would suggest, instead of doing that, migrating those files into Drive. It will surely make the management and sharing of those files easier. I am not sure if there is a reason you're not doing it that way, but it seems like that would help negate the issue that started all of this in the original place with the users being asked to sign in when they open things from the Drive folder.\ncomments: Hello Mike,\n\nI have got the access to delete this personal profile.

They explained that the exclusions won't apply in a manual scan. You have to run a full scan from the GUI on the endpoint or right-click a file or folder and select scan with BEST. This said, scheduled scans will apply the exclusions. It comprises Full Scans, Network Scans, and Custom Scans. The Device scan should apply the exclusions if a scheduled scan is run. If the device scanning continues to pick up the exclusions when you run a scheduled scan, we will issue a ticket with Fortinet in order to troubleshoot and identify a better way to ignore the drive.\ncomments: Thanks Heather,\n\nThis issue with device scans not applying the custom exclusions has already been observed, and the logs account for that. The users are not running manual scans, I know that. Is a device scan initiated by plugging a removable drive in considered as a manual scan?

We tried earlier to move that customer, Annie Turcios from one household (accidentally created) to another. I informed that at this point of time customers cannot be directly shifted from one household to another. Customers that need to be shifted must first be split from their current household and then combined into their new household. We kind of did that, but inadvertently another member was shifted Aflec Velazquez/Velasquez (we have to check on how to spell his surname which was also updated). Shifting Aflec was ok, because they need to be under the same household anyways. Just to confirm the household is now currently set up in Aflec Velazquez's name with Annie Turcios listed as a member. Note that I did see Annie listed twice as a person in Apex, and each Annie shows as a member in two households... I want her to stay under Aflec, so combined the two, but csr could not do that (one was policy the other was a quote) but then when I had the agency on hold to review knowledge documents, they tried to do something similar with the children that needed to come over to Aflec Velazquez's household and now the children are on their own household, listed as members. Have since helped in shifting one child Francis over, and combining the household of the son Adan, to appear on Aflec's. \nState: Closed\n\n\n\n",

Until the mobile number available for her Milwaukee office comes, can we delete her mobile from the website and use the Menomonee Falls mobile number for both locations? Only until the Milwaukee number is available, and at that time, add that to the Milwaukee location \n2. Second, her Menomonee Falls address needs to be updated to the PRIMARY location, how can we do this? Is there an e-form that needs to be submitted? \n3. Third, the book of business she is set to receive is \"banked\" with the storefront location, if possible we need to transfer that book to Maria on September 24th, should I do the book transfer e-form as it is banked with the storefront or does someone at the storefront need to complete it? \n4. How do we remove the voicemail from the prior agent associated with the Menomonee Falls mobile number so that Maria can set up her mobile system accordingly? \n5. How do we allign the correct staff with each location on the agent website? Is that something that Maria is able to do?\n\nThank you so much for your help!\n\n\nThanks,\n\nAmit Bruner\n\nState: Closed\n\nwork_notes: KANDREW2@ameam.com 09/20/2021 16:15:06\nHi Amit,\nThanks for your email. \nI've made the Menomonee office primary and added that mobile number to the Milwaukee office in place of Maria's mobile. \nIf her mobiles are on Agency Connect, she can contact them for help with the voicemail update: ameamagencyconnect@ameam.com or x31121\nFAST would be able to assist on this with the question about assigning staff to the correct location on an agent website.

This is a mandatory information. \n\nNext Steps:  \n1.As per discussion with Arya, After talking to UXCE, it is suggested that we use an AX job to insert the records.  Internally, AX manages an auto-increment field on that table.  Adding the records through a job will ensure that the value in this field is created properly.\n2.

The primary focus was on the 43 (not 35) customers in company 310 that donot have US state tax exemption records.  Apart from these are just bonus; It shouldn't be a problem if left, but we should not take that chance, so we should be filling them.\ncomments: David.Loo@sgsintl.com 2013-12-18 14:12\nUPDATE FROM Savannah Kesich:\nI have checked each one of them and they have all states listed in UAT to apply tax exemptions if applicable.\nThanks\nSavannah\n\n\ncomments: Beth.Anglin@sgsintl.com 2014-01-08 13:29\nWhen can we move this AX job to PROD?\ncomments: Beth.Anglin@sgsintl.com 2014-01-13 14:17\nThis job is now available in PROD.

Ned corrected that my permissions for running it were not set correctly.  The summary file column headings and the workbook column headings did not match (the order of the columns). Ned corrected the mistake and send me the updated workbook to test.  To validate it, we will need to be ran simultaneously with the DAX extracts at May close to insure they are using the same tax data.  Per Ned due to the updates that occur to the tax tables, this is time sensitive.  This workbook will be ran along with the extracts on May 4th.  Once May reports are balanced the workbook will be compared to the extracts to insure all data matches.     \ncomments: CORRECTION TO DATE:  Ned and I met 5/24/17 to discuss the extract workbook.

This is called a lifestyle event and broadly includes things like births, marriage, deaths, etc. You can apply for a lifestyle event by navigating to the person icon in the top right corner of the benefits portal and selecting \"change in circumstance\"\n** Please note; when you add dependents to your benefits portal, they do not automatically add to the policies, the dependants must be added manually by yourself. \n\nYou will need to submit a lifestyle event to add your son to your policies.  You can do this by going to the ServiceNow Benefits portal and submitting a 'Change in Circumstance' (see screenshot attached for where you can find this).  Once this has been submitted, it will go through for approval and once approved you will be given a window where you can go in and add your son to your policies.  \n\nOnce your lifestlye event has been approved and you have received the window to make changes, go to the ServiceNow Benefits portal, click the benefit you wish to add him to e.g. 'Private Medical Insurance' > click 'View' > click 'Add a dependant' > Select your son > Submit and repeat for any other policies as nrequired. \n \nI will now close out your case but please feel free to reopen and let me know if you require any further support.\n \nHave a great rest of your day!\nHR Agent \n \nPlease note, you will receive a survey to complete regarding your HR Case experience with the Global Talent team and would be grateful if you could provide your feedback.

As you see from the screenshots I shared previously, I've done those steps by adding my son as a dependant. However, the window seems not open so I can't add him into my medical and dental insurances. When I add him as a dependant I remember the window was given this week but somehow I can't go and confirm the date. So could you tell me when is the next window that I can make the required changes? \n\nThanks\n\n\ncomments: \nHi John,\n\nGreat, thank you for confirming you were able to add your son. \n\nI have just had a look in the back end of the system and can see you have updated your medical and dental from couple cover to family cover and your son, Torin Doe has been added as a dependant to both policies which will be effective 01/06/2023.\n\nI will now close your case but any further questions, please let me know.\n\nThanks! \nHR Agent\n\n\nwork_notes: Case reopened by Service-now: Rohan Babli [maint,admin,itil]\n\n\n",

I wanted to double check I didn't miss anything since I just received the CZ information (last week) and hadn't been made aware there was additional steps for me to take in order to be compliant with local law (except from that Fragomen message I copy/paste below that told me to contact Global Mobility who then redirected me to yet another service). \n\nAt this point, all is clear on my side. I hope I won't be in any kind of trouble for contracting an insurance a few months after relocating due to some gaps in the internal process!  \n\nThanks for your support and your clear answers. \n\nKind regards,\nJohn\n\n\ncomments: \n@HR Agent\nThanks for the information. Both links are working now. \n\nI'm still unsure if I already have an medical insurance or if I need to contract one.\n\n\nwork_notes: \nHey @Maria Clesham,\n\nDo you know if NL employees are automatically enrolled in Health Insurance when they are hired / transferred?  As per the KB0052192 : Employee Benefits - Netherlands KBA it says the below which makes me think they still need to enroll:\n\nNew to ServiceNow? You will receive an email from our Employee Benefits Broker, Schouten Zekerheid, containing a video link that will provide you with details of our benefits plans and how to enroll in voluntary schemes should you wish to. Alternatively, you can enroll now by clicking here. \n\nAre you able to confirm?\n\nThanks! \nHR Agent\n\n\ncomments: \nHi John,\n\nI hope you are doing well & had a great weekend!  \n\nI am not sure I fully understand your question here.  As per the KB0052192 : Employee Benefits - Netherlands knowledge article, it confirms the schemes are voluntary for you to sign up to should you wish but if you are new to ServiceNow (including new to The Netherlands) that you will still need to enroll.  The knowledge article includes links on how to enroll and contact details direct to the broker for questions regarding enrollment.  If I am not understanding correctly, please let me know if you would like to jump on a call to go through in more detail? I have also reached out to my team to clarify so will let you know when I have an update there. \n\nRegarding your relocation query, this would be something that Global Mobility  would be able to advise on as my team and I wouldn't have visibility to any social security arrangement.  I have sent Global Mobility an email with your question and yourself in CC for their guidance on that. \n\nThanks! \nHR Agent\n\n\ncomments: \nHi John,\n\nPlease can I kindly recommend having a look at the KB0052192 : Employee Benefits - Netherlands knowledge article which provides further guidance regarding the Health Insurance as well as contact details to reach out to the brokers directly. \n\nIn addition, the KB0051840 : Benefit Summaries - EMEA knowledge article is back up and running. \n\nI will now close out your case but please feel free to reopen and let me know if you require any further support.\n \nHave a great rest of your day!\nHR Agent \n \nPlease note, you will receive a survey to complete regarding your HR Case experience with the Global Talent team and would be grateful if you could provide your feedback.

I would think that is a ServiceNow question.\n\nWhen I completed my relocation to The Netherlands the company in charge of my transfer (Fragomen) told me to reach out to global mobility about the below.\n\n\"Dear John, \n\nThank you for sending a copy of your registration documents. The process is now complete.\n\n\"Please keep in mind that since you registered with town hall as resident of the Netherlands you are required to obtain Dutch health insurance. In a few instances you may be exempted from this requirement, but this will depend on the social security arrangement between your home country and the Netherlands. \n\nPlease review the attached brochure, which contains information on your rights and duties as a EU national and how to remain compliant with Dutch immigration laws.\"\n\nI've attached the brochure she is referering to.\n\n\ncomments: \n@[Raghunath Ganeshan] @[HR Agent]\nHi,\nSorry for the delay in getting back to you. \nI'm attaching the handbook, it was downloaded from this KB while it was still accessible, (p.20; section 7.3 ) that was send to me during the relocation process.

Can I confirm how long the 36.5 days will carry over for? Is it ongoing or does it expire at the end of 2023?\n- That's correct, you will have until 31 December 2023 to use these days and can carry 5 into 2024 as per the KB0056548 : Time Away - UK knowledge article.\n\n2) I ve just done a check on my PTO and I think my total days from 2022 is actually 37.5. I think I carried over 3.5 from 2021 + 25 days PTO + 9 public holidays (the extra one being the Queen s funeral). Please may you check for me?\n- That's correct, I have updated your balance to 37.5 days due to the extra bank holiday\n\n3) Unfortunately, that doesn t quite answer my question. I d read something online about this, but it might not be applicable to how ServiceNow pay it s bonus so I ll leave this one.\n- I am checking with the comp team and will let you know when I have an update.\n\n4) You got me thinking with the response. I wouldn t have said that a KIT day is  time off , because I m working. It s a working day. Can you confirm how we treat it, even though we log it as time off request, but I thought maybe that was a Workday limitation.\n- I am checking with the comp team and will let you know when I have an update.\n\n5) A new ask   I m confused about the balance showing in Workday at the moment. It shows as 41.5 days but I m not sure how this is calculated. Also, when I check to see my balance as of 31 Dec 2023, it s showing back as 36.5. Any help you can provide will be great.\n- The additional 5 days are carryover which is from 2022 which shouldn't be there.

I have informed payroll and as discussed, due to the confirmation coming in after payroll cut off, this will not be captured until February 2023 payroll. \n\nI will now close out your case but please feel free to reopen and let me know if you require any further support.\n \nHave a great rest of your day!\nHR Agent \n \nPlease note, you will receive a survey to complete regarding your HR Case experience with the Global Talent team and would be grateful if you could provide your feedback.

I appreciate your help, as always.\n\nSo to confirm, for 2023 I will have:\n\n  *   37.5 days carried over from 2022\n  *   25 PTO days for 2023\n  *   1 public holiday day carried over from New Years Day 2022\n  *   TOTAL = 63.5 PTO days\n\nAnd then based on my understanding, I will then need to use or loose all of these days, excluding the 5 I can carry over into 2024, is that right? It s going to be quite difficult to take this many days in one year. I d already started thinking about shortening my mat leave and replacing the final weeks with PTO, so I ll need to do this ASAP if I really will lose the holiday days if I m unable to take them.\n\nThanks,\nJohn\n\n\nwork_notes: \n* &nbsp;Processed in WD with comment 'Updating estimated last day of leave to 31/12/2022 as confirmed via HRC0449230' and 'HRC0449230 &amp; HRC0297061'* &nbsp;Payroll Request Raised: &nbsp;FR0261771\n\n\ncomments: \nHi John, \n\nThank you for confirming. I will get this processed and let you know when complete.  \n\nRegarding KIT dates, I received confirmation that these are recorded as 'Other Time Off (Global)' in Workday (in order to generate payment), but they are a working day.  That said, employees aren't eligible for bonus on those days as employees are still on maternity leave during that time (and still recorded as  on leave ). KIT days can only be taken during maternity leave, which essentially take the precedent for bonus eligibility.\n\nThanks! \nHR Agent\n\n\nwork_notes: Case reopened by Service-now: Rohan Babli [maint,admin,itil]\n\n\n",
