This looks to be indefinite. \n  \nIt happens in multiple browsers. BTW, we are using Microsoft Edge. \n  \nIn the O-instance no issues with opening the Plugins page.\ncomments: Some additional information in the attached screenshots (from developer tools in Edge) \n \nThe message \"you have been redirected to All Applications. To see the Plugins list click here\" does appear. The table v_plugin is shown after clicking on the link in the message. When you close the message only the Loading text is shown \n \nAnd or what it's worth, opening sys_plugin.list and sys_scope.list from the navigator works fine. Both lists open within 1 second, but these lists doesn't give the actions like  'Find in store' or 'Request Plugin'\nwork_notes: @Salim Kassongo (NOW), The customer has escalated the case and looking for an update, I understand this is an on-prem solution, I guess you have the necessary screenshots below, can you please expedite the case and next steps.\ncomments: Hello Ron, \n \nMy name is Norma Robles and I am I am a Customer Support Team Lead with ServiceNow.

Following my previous comment, I received confirmation from the time off team that as per the ServiceNow policy as outlines in the KB0048146 : Parental leave process - EMEA knowledge article, the ServiceNow Paid Parental Leave applies to all regular ServiceNow employees who are actively employed and have not given or received notice of termination and are welcoming a child into their home, either through birth, adoption, foster placement, or surrogacy while employed at ServiceNow.\n\nThat being said, unfortunately there are no exceptions to this Global Policy which means Jakob will not be eligible to the parental leave. I appreciate this will not be the answer Jakob will be hoping for, however this is a Global policy which is in place to ensure a fair and consistent approach for all employees. \n\nI will now close out your case but please feel free to reopen and let me know if you require any further support.\n \nHave a great rest of your day!\nHR Agent \n \nPlease note, you will receive a survey to complete regarding your HR Case experience with the Global Talent team and would be grateful if you could provide your feedback.

We tried earlier to move that customer, Annie Turcios from one household (accidentally created) to another. I informed that at this point of time customers cannot be directly shifted from one household to another. Customers that need to be shifted must first be split from their current household and then combined into their new household. We kind of did that, but inadvertently another member was shifted Aflec Velazquez/Velasquez (we have to check on how to spell his surname which was also updated). Shifting Aflec was ok, because they need to be under the same household anyways. Just to confirm the household is now currently set up in Aflec Velazquez's name with Annie Turcios listed as a member. Note that I did see Annie listed twice as a person in Apex, and each Annie shows as a member in two households... I want her to stay under Aflec, so combined the two, but csr could not do that (one was policy the other was a quote) but then when I had the agency on hold to review knowledge documents, they tried to do something similar with the children that needed to come over to Aflec Velazquez's household and now the children are on their own household, listed as members. Have since helped in shifting one child Francis over, and combining the household of the son Adan, to appear on Aflec's. \nState: Closed\n\n\n\n<|end|>\n<|user|>\nThe above case documents an interaction between an agent and a customer.

Many hosting providers offer WAF capabilities as well. - URL:https://community.orbussoftware.com/community \n \n  Web Application Firewall (WAF) is not currently in place given the nature of the ServiceNow platform architecture. Because of the nature of the ServiceNow platform, a WAF implementation would be highly complex and might result in blocking legitimate traffic due to the myriad ways ServiceNow instances are used by customers. In the absence of a WAF, ServiceNow has implemented compensating controls that customers can manage within their instance. \n \nServiceNow has performed significant testing using WAF capabilities across the platform that resulted in severe performance and availability impacts to instances. After tuning WAF protections to eliminate the negative impacts, the resulting security enhancements were determined to be minimal at best. Security controls already built into customer instances via the Instance Security Center are available to customers to provide greater protection levels than a ServiceNow-managed WAF due to the various use cases in how customers configure and use their instances. Many of these controls help protect against OWASP Top Ten and other attacks. Additionally, customers have the ability to adopt third-party WAF solutions, such as Cloudflare, if the presence of a WAF is a mandatory requirement. \n \n2) Website does not implement X-XSS-Protection Best Practices - Add the following header to responses from this website: 'X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block' - URL:https://community.orbussoftware.com/community \n \n  Due to the customizability of the platform, ServiceNow has decided not to implement the X-XSS protection header out of the box and instead relies on other mitigations for XSS protection. ServiceNow allows customers to extend the platform in numerous ways that could be impacted by setting this header out of the box. ServiceNow performs input validation in the form of input escaping and output encoding for JS, HTML, NG and Jelly technologies. A combinational approach is used based on the usage and nature of the data being consumed by the application. The platform has configurations in the form of system properties that controls the security behaviour for Input Validations and Database operations. You can find these configurations via ServiceNow Instance Hardening. Specifically, information about the HTML Sanitizer can be found here: https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=c_HTMLSanitizer.html&version=platform. \n \nFor more information on this please see the following resources \n- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-XSS-Protection \n- https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/HTTP_Headers_Cheat_Sheet.html \n \n3) Content Security Policy Contains Broad Directives - Explicitly specify trusted sources for your script-src and object-src policies. Ideally, you can use the 'self' directive to limit scripts and objects to only those on your own domain, or you can explicitly specify domains that you trust and rely upon for your site to function. - URL:https://community.orbussoftware.com/community \n \n  Given the flexible nature of the platform, each customer's use cases will be unique, and one value for the Content-Security-Policy (CSP) header may work well for one customer but may impact another customer. As such ServiceNow does not set this header out of the box. \n  \nIf your security team feels this header is necessary to be set, your instance administrators can configure HTTP response headers for all, or specific types of pages, which include Service Portal, UI Page, or UX applications.

I don't think I mentioned SAM either. \n \nOur concerns are about the variation in Operating System values from Tanium Asset SGC (the \"os\" field on \"cmdb_ci_computer\" table). Our concern is if we run Tanium Asset SGC, it will fill in Operating System with values that are not consistent with Discovery or other Service Graph Connectors. \n \nWe have IRE in place and have a great deal of experience with it. I even have a knowledge article I wrote for our users that explains our reconciliation definitions (basically the order of \"precedence\" for each Discovery Source) \nhttps://pdsm.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB000224310 \n \nThe Operating System field is a very important field for reporting and CMDB processes. We use \"Linux Red Hat\" specifically for Linux Patch Status calculation (use Operating System + OS Version + Kernel Release to populate a custom Patch Status field). We only calculate for Linux Red Hat, no other Linux variants. \nTanium seems to be bringing in an entirely new set of operating systems unlike anything we have seen before, and it would cause disruption for reporting and Linux Patch Status calculation (at least) if Tanium started updating Operating System on devices where the highest priority Discovery Source is Tanium. \nPlease look at my text from 2023-05-22 and notice how incredibly different Tanium would be providing Operating System for Linux devices. ServiceNow Discovery just puts \"Linux Red Hat\" (as long as it is actually red hat) and lets the numbers go into OS Version. \n \nIf we place Tanium Asset SGC higher priority over other sources (which would be consistent with how we have treated SCCM SGC and Intune SGC) it could take ownership of that field for a lot of CIs and drastically change the data landscape for Operating System. Even if we put it with the same priority we put to our existing custom Tanium integration, it would still be disruptive due to how different the Operating System data is.\n\n\nwork_notes: Auto-agent: Case moved to automation user based on rules in \"Case - Need task completion - Start\" configuration.\nwork_notes: CSTASK579542 (CS - Integrations) Task notes  updated by now.autoagent\n\nAuto-agent: This is an automated reminder that this task is pending your update.

It is updating the OS to a new value as seen in attached screenshot.  \n \nOS value is derived by below SG-Tanium operation. You can see that it takes \"operating_system\" as input and outputs \"u_converted_operating_system\" through the \"Cleanse Operating System\" operation. \n \nhttps://fedexdev01.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=sn_cmdb_int_util_cleanse_os_operation.do?sys_id=daa9a5fa532830106747ddeeff7b1236 \nhttps://fedexdev01.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=sys_rte_eb_operation_type.do?sys_id=02586738735500102b6265a751ab9e63 \n \nThe source data has operating_system as \"Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 7.9 (Maipo)\" and this operation returns the cleansed operating system as \"Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 7.9 (Maipo)\" and that directly goes to the OS field on the CI.  \n \nIf you trace the script you will arrive at below code which is checking if the operating_system passed to it exists in sys_choice or not. When it does not find one it insert one and when it finds one it reuses it.  \n \nhttps://fedexdev01.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=sys_script_include.do?sys_id=5107787137203000dcd48c00dfbe5da7 \n \nSG-Tanium should send \"Linux Red Hat\" instead of \"Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 7.9 (Maipo)\". Looks like other discovery sources send it as \"Linux Red Hat\" and it works for them. Customer needs to work with Tanium on this.\n\n\nwork_notes: The blocking task CSTASK579542 with blocking reason Need Task Completion is closed by Venkatesh Parkala Shenoy (NOW)\nwork_notes: GQM Note: @Piotr Dziarmaga (NOW) to review the task update and follow up.

I look forward to working with you to resolve this.   I could not find any existing documentation around this issue.  \n\nYes.  When users are trying to copy and select multiple tasks and past them, New Project Workspace, creates new items, but the WBS numbers for the pasted items are blank.\ncomments: Hello Dwayne,    \n \n My name is MeKinley Saint Victor, and I will assist you with your Case. I would like to confirm the following is correct for the issue you are currently facing:  \n \nInvestigation Summary:     \nPlease, if not listed already, provide a sub-prod that you have confirmed the issue exists in which we can conduct troubleshooting. If there is no sub prod seeing this issue do we have permission to spin a temp instance of Prod to conduct further troubleshooting? Otherwise please note, we do not make changes to Prod environments and thus investigating the issue may become inconclusive.  \n \n**should any of your instances require access grant permission to mekinley.saintvictor** \n \nIn addition, please provide record numbers/links as examples and clear concise steps to reproduce the issue. Without the proper steps to reproduce, we will not be able to determine the root cause of the issue. \n \nIf there are specific users experiencing this issue, please list them as well so that we may troubleshoot accordingly. Thank you! \n \nPlease note, intermittent issues will be difficult to conclude without steps to reproduce. If your issue is intermittent please provide an example within 3 days' time so that we may collect the logs. Though logs may not always tell us the exact root cause, they can bring us closer to determining the issue. \n \nNext Steps:    \nUntil then I will be testing some things OOB, thank you! \n \n*** \n \nAs part of the troubleshooting process, I and other ServiceNow personnel may need to access your instance(s) in order to review the service impact to your instance and determine the root cause.

They explained that the exclusions won't apply in a manual scan. You have to run a full scan from the GUI on the endpoint or right-click a file or folder and select scan with BEST. This said, scheduled scans will apply the exclusions. It comprises Full Scans, Network Scans, and Custom Scans. The Device scan should apply the exclusions if a scheduled scan is run. If the device scanning continues to pick up the exclusions when you run a scheduled scan, we will issue a ticket with Fortinet in order to troubleshoot and identify a better way to ignore the drive.\ncomments: Thanks Heather,\n\nThis issue with device scans not applying the custom exclusions has already been observed, and the logs account for that. The users are not running manual scans, I know that. Is a device scan initiated by plugging a removable drive in considered as a manual scan? Maybe that's why the cloud storage isn t being ignored in this case?\n\nRegards,\nMark\n\n[1]\n\nMark Hazimov\nTechnician\n\nData Consulting Group\n1456 Union Drive, Ste Z, San Francisco, CA 94000\nOffice # : (674) 432-8765 x290\n\nFrom: Magna5 Support \nSent: Tuesday, May 09, 2020 10:10\nTo: Bob Wilson ; Mark Hazimov \nSubject: Case MAG0011322 has been updated\ncomments: Yes, it's plausible.

Thank you for the help.\n\n\"Also kindly let us know some of the email where they are read and not removed so we can check the records on our end.\"\n\nRegarding the above, any email in the 'Received' inbox after 3:40 PM CST meet that criteria. All emails from then until about 5 PM were manually processed by triggering the Email Reader job, deleting the emails that it read, and repeating those steps until the inbox was cleared. We were forced to delete the emails manually because otherwise, the Email Reader job would not read and process any more emails. However, I will say that it can read new emails if there are a couple of others marked as read, but there seems to be a limit of sorts.\n\nFor the most recent example, though, see the email record linked below. It's the most recent email to come in and is currently still sitting in the Inbox of ServiceCenter@morsco.com, marked as read, but not deleted. \n\nEmail:\nhttps://morsco.service-now.com/sys_email.do?sys_id=dd2e35fd87687590dd34cb3c8bbb35ae&sysparm_view=inbox&sysparm_record_target=sys_email&sysparm_record_row=1&sysparm_record_rows=206&sysparm_record_list=mailbox%3Dreceived%5Esys_created_onONToday%40javascript%3Ags.daysAgoStart%280%29%40javascript%3Ags.daysAgoEnd%280%29%5EORDERBYDESCsys_created_on\n\nLet me know if there are any other details I can provide.\nwork_notes: The blocking task CS6827524 with blocking reason Need Information From Customer is closed by Dylan Huchens\nwork_notes: KB0784213 : Email Sending / Receiving is shown as non-operational in Email Diagnostics Page \nKB0784213 - Email Sending / Receiving is shown as non-operational in Email Diagnostics Page - Perma Link [Public]\nwork_notes: Customer supplied email: https://morsco.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=sys_email.do?sys_id=dd2e35fd87687590dd34cb3c8bbb35ae%26sysparm_view=inbox \n \nAs per the splunk search below: \nhttps://splunk.servicenow.net/en-US/app/search/search?earliest=1691452800&latest=1691798400&q=search%20PH0PR13MB56681EB8BE083ED73D98176FB013A%40PH0PR13MB5668.namprd13.prod.outlook.com&display.page.search.mode=verbose&dispatch.sample_ratio=1&sid=1691635056.35208_2E64B6A5-3172-4185-9C7D-0DCE1FF179CF \n \nThe email was not deleted and when the instance tired to fetch the email it continuously discarded the email and tried to delete it as well.\nwork_notes: CSTASK633425 (Task HOP) has been created\nwork_notes: https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0816001\nwork_notes: KB0816001 : How Emails with Duplicate Message ID's are Handled in ServiceNow \nKB0816001 - How Emails with Duplicate Message ID's are Handled in ServiceNow - Perma Link [Public] \nKB0688478 : Emails Are Not Being Delivered to the ServiceNow Instance via a POP3 or IMAP Microsoft Exchange Email Account \nKB0688478 - Emails Are Not Being Delivered to the ServiceNow Instance via a POP3 or IMAP Microsoft Exchange Email Account - Perma Link [Public]\nwork_notes: Needs attention flag is manually unset by Madhukar Regmi\nwork_notes: Auto close workflow is TRIGGERED for the case.

Until the mobile number available for her Milwaukee office comes, can we delete her mobile from the website and use the Menomonee Falls mobile number for both locations? Only until the Milwaukee number is available, and at that time, add that to the Milwaukee location \n2. Second, her Menomonee Falls address needs to be updated to the PRIMARY location, how can we do this? Is there an e-form that needs to be submitted? \n3. Third, the book of business she is set to receive is \"banked\" with the storefront location, if possible we need to transfer that book to Maria on September 24th, should I do the book transfer e-form as it is banked with the storefront or does someone at the storefront need to complete it? \n4. How do we remove the voicemail from the prior agent associated with the Menomonee Falls mobile number so that Maria can set up her mobile system accordingly? \n5. How do we allign the correct staff with each location on the agent website? Is that something that Maria is able to do?\n\nThank you so much for your help!\n\n\nThanks,\n\nAmit Bruner\n\nState: Closed\n\nwork_notes: KANDREW2@ameam.com 09/20/2021 16:15:06\nHi Amit,\nThanks for your email. \nI've made the Menomonee office primary and added that mobile number to the Milwaukee office in place of Maria's mobile. \nIf her mobiles are on Agency Connect, she can contact them for help with the voicemail update: ameamagencyconnect@ameam.com or x31121\nFAST would be able to assist on this with the question about assigning staff to the correct location on an agent website. They can be reached at FAST@ameam.com or x78017.\n\nRegarding banked agency, if you can tell me who the terminated agent was, I'll connect you with the specialist who's handling distribution of the banked policies.\nThanks!\nKam\n\n\n\n<|end|>\n<|user|>\nThe above case documents an interaction between an agent and a customer. Please provide notes on how the case was resolved or is proposed to be resolved that the agent can share with the customer.<|end|>\n<|assistant|>",

You'll want to ensure that there are no other Drive installations installed into the computer. Also ensure that the main account signed in is within the local account. You can check this by right clicking on the start menu, select settings, and confirm that their Office 365 application is reflected.

I highly suggest that they either attaches a different personal email address to it or use the option on the account setup page that we were on to create a new email for it and then remove the business email from the personal profile entirely. I have seen this kind of set up cause nothing but problems. Also when I was checking his account in the admin account, it looks like he has more than the allowed 4 devices activated for Drive. I would check with the user to see if some of those can be removed. \n  \n Another thing I noticed was how your team had the separate account for Drive. Is that where users store shared files? I would suggest, instead of doing that, migrating those files into Drive. It will surely make the management and sharing of those files easier. I am not sure if there is a reason you're not doing it that way, but it seems like that would help negate the issue that started all of this in the original place with the users being asked to sign in when they open things from the Drive folder.\ncomments: Hello Mike,\n\nI have got the access to delete this personal profile.

After tuning WAF protections to eliminate the negative impacts, the resulting security enhancements were determined to be minimal at best.  Security controls already built into customer instances via the Instance Security Center are available to customers to provide greater protection levels than a ServiceNow managed WAF due to the various use-cases in how customers configure and use their instances. Many of these controls help protect against OWASP Top Ten and other attacks.

Can I confirm how long the 36.5 days will carry over for? Is it ongoing or does it expire at the end of 2023?\n- That's correct, you will have until 31 December 2023 to use these days and can carry 5 into 2024 as per the KB0056548 : Time Away - UK knowledge article.\n\n2) I ve just done a check on my PTO and I think my total days from 2022 is actually 37.5. I think I carried over 3.5 from 2021 + 25 days PTO + 9 public holidays (the extra one being the Queen s funeral). Please may you check for me?\n- That's correct, I have updated your balance to 37.5 days due to the extra bank holiday\n\n3) Unfortunately, that doesn t quite answer my question. I d read something online about this, but it might not be applicable to how ServiceNow pay it s bonus so I ll leave this one.\n- I am checking with the comp team and will let you know when I have an update.\n\n4) You got me thinking with the response. I wouldn t have said that a KIT day is  time off , because I m working. It s a working day. Can you confirm how we treat it, even though we log it as time off request, but I thought maybe that was a Workday limitation.\n- I am checking with the comp team and will let you know when I have an update.\n\n5) A new ask   I m confused about the balance showing in Workday at the moment. It shows as 41.5 days but I m not sure how this is calculated. Also, when I check to see my balance as of 31 Dec 2023, it s showing back as 36.5. Any help you can provide will be great.\n- The additional 5 days are carryover which is from 2022 which shouldn't be there.

I have informed payroll and as discussed, due to the confirmation coming in after payroll cut off, this will not be captured until February 2023 payroll. \n\nI will now close out your case but please feel free to reopen and let me know if you require any further support.\n \nHave a great rest of your day!\nHR Agent \n \nPlease note, you will receive a survey to complete regarding your HR Case experience with the Global Talent team and would be grateful if you could provide your feedback. Thank you in advance for your time!   \n\n\ncomments: \nreply from: XXXXXXXXXservicenow.com\n\nThank you so much HR Agent! I appreciate your help, as always.\n\nSo to confirm, for 2023 I will have:\n\n  *   37.5 days carried over from 2022\n  *   25 PTO days for 2023\n  *   1 public holiday day carried over from New Years Day 2022\n  *   TOTAL = 63.5 PTO days\n\nAnd then based on my understanding, I will then need to use or loose all of these days, excluding the 5 I can carry over into 2024, is that right? It s going to be quite difficult to take this many days in one year. I d already started thinking about shortening my mat leave and replacing the final weeks with PTO, so I ll need to do this ASAP if I really will lose the holiday days if I m unable to take them.\n\nThanks,\nJohn\n\n\nwork_notes: \n* &nbsp;Processed in WD with comment 'Updating estimated last day of leave to 31/12/2022 as confirmed via HRC0449230' and 'HRC0449230 &amp; HRC0297061'* &nbsp;Payroll Request Raised: &nbsp;FR0261771\n\n\ncomments: \nHi John, \n\nThank you for confirming. I will get this processed and let you know when complete.  \n\nRegarding KIT dates, I received confirmation that these are recorded as 'Other Time Off (Global)' in Workday (in order to generate payment), but they are a working day.  That said, employees aren't eligible for bonus on those days as employees are still on maternity leave during that time (and still recorded as  on leave ). KIT days can only be taken during maternity leave, which essentially take the precedent for bonus eligibility.\n\nThanks! \nHR Agent\n\n\nwork_notes: Case reopened by Service-now: Rohan Babli [maint,admin,itil]\n\n\n<|end|>\n<|user|>\nThe above case documents an interaction between an agent and a customer.

This includes 3rd parties that provide connectivity to Equinix itself. Customers have various methods of connecting to the Equinix backbone in order to peer with ServiceNow and other cloud services. As such ServiceNow cannot maintain sole responsibility for ECX peering's. \nServiceNow continues to recommend that for ECX peering issues customers create cases with Equinix, ServiceNow, and any third parties customers might use for connection to Equinix.\"\nu_technical_action_plan_journal: ********TECHNICAL ACTION PLAN******** \nupdated by Jaba   K k on 17:14 CET on June 2nd, 2023 \n \nISSUE SUMMARY & STATUS: \nNetwork: BGP Peer between customer network and ServiceNow has been dropped (not Service Affecting). \nIssue solved some time ago, discussions with customer are on-going, do not FTS or reassign without checking SAM or EMEA Integrations Leadership \n \nSTEPS TAKEN \n* Jan 25 Customer Raises P2 noting Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) connectivity between DWP, and ServiceNow had failed. Their BGP network interface was showing as 'up', but could not establish a BGP peer connection. \n* Jan 26 CSTASK501623 CNS Backbone (aka Net Eng) \nBGP session drop was caused by issue on ISP network. Issue has been fixed permanently - \"Service is up and stable since 25/01/2023 21:17 GMT\" \n* Feb 1 CSTASK504933 Net Eng There is no cost out involved when a circuit (Colt in this case) physically is not working. There is no mechanism for customer notifications when we observe a circuit go down. These are common occurrences and are the reason for redundant physical connections. \n* Feb 27 Post Case Review for CS6467513  \n.. \nCS determined that DWP's connectivity was affected by their internal network configuration, meaning that the in-place redundancy options were not utilized. As the redundancy options did not auto-resolve, DWP experienced connectivity failure until the issue was resolved at 21:17 (Jan 25). \nPreventative Measures: \nServiceNow recommends that DWP review internal network configurations to avail of all available redundancy as provided by ServiceNow. \n.. \nThe ISP, COLT, experienced a hardware failure at their Newport exchange, disrupting BGP connectivity for DWP. ServiceNow provides three other BGP sessions as a redundancy measure, but DWP traffic could not avail of these, likely due to an internal network configuration. \n.. \n* March 13 Customer notes \"The preventative measure is completely unfeasible and not helpful at all - there is no detail as to what ServiceNow recommend we do.\" \n* May 5 Customer attaches ServiceNowLLDDiagram.pdf noting \"I've attached an overview of our network connectivity - please note that this dedicated connectivity is mirrored for each ServiceNow datacentre.\" \n* May 10 SAM team suggest Technical Support should keep this (Customer network Diagram) on record, under a KB, so that in the event of future network related cases, we have a basis to work on and if we need to engage with our network team, they have this diagram to work from as well. \n* May 11 CSTASK571012  raised for Net Eng to use ServiceNowLLDDiagram.pdf as input to add some detail to Post Case Review (aka RCA)  Preventative Measures to address Customer concerns March 13. \n* Meeting invite sent by Gregson  for May 15 12.00 UK - \"Discuss case CS6467513 BGP Network issues with DWP\". Invitees: Gregson Townsend, James Harland, Nadia Raychinova, David Arzola, Dielle Walker and Tony Barratt. \n* MAY 15: Meeting took place as scheduled. Attendees Gregson Townsend, James Harland, Nadia Raychinova,  Dielle Walker. \nResponse on CSTASK571012 was considered: \n\"Regarding diagram - it does show they have redundant connections in each DC, and in case primary BGP connection (red line) goes down, traffic should be automatically rerouted to blue line. I can't say much if it's the case without seeing at least some config/routing policy on their side.  \nIf they really experienced the issue affecting their traffic when red connection was down, it would be helpful to get analysis  from their side why traffic didn't switch to blue line (and *maybe* we can advise what can be done to fix the issue). \nRegarding support model - same as before, they open case with us in case BGP is down, case is assigned to Network Engineering group and engineer investigate why BGP is down and what (if anything) can be done to fix it. It didn't work well this time (network team was too late with picking up the case), but anyway we wouldn't be able to do much, just update customer, like, ok, 3rd party is down, they are working on bringing it up, but you have redundant connection, use it.\" \nAfter the meeting was concluded, SAM  team passed onto the Customer  the comments on the network diagram from CSTASK571012 and requested further information on the Customer network configuration. \nSAM team committed to creating a KB, intended audience Technical Support teams. KB to contain  Network Diagram to assist with any future Network related issues.  \n*  May 17: Customer responded to SAM Team update of May 15 voicing concerns. \nExample: I (Customer)  have little to no faith that if a BGP peer fails in the future, that ServiceNow will either notify us or treat our cases with the priority that they (Customer) require.  \n* May 22 As per meeting  - Intention is that we will meet with DWP Phil  and Dan + any interested parties on their side + Chris/Olga/Sean/Tech Support +optionally Kavitha Annamaneni (Director, Global Cloud Observability). \nIt was noted during meeting by Chris and Sean that we could  auto-generate Customer-facing cases for ECX or CDC peering, but whether we should seemed unclear. \nEvidently we could  auto-generate Customer-facing cases. If so, this rasies the question what actions could/should be taken by NOW or DWP ie a runbook. \n* May 23: Gregson is liaising with DWP about a meetup between DWP and stakeholders (Sean and Chris for example)  on our side.  \n* May 31st; internal meeting with Chris/Sean/Kavitha Annamaneni (Director, Global Cloud Observability)/Support. It was decided that \n** SN already monitors BGP connections and detects failures \n** There are no plans to create customer facing cases for BGP connection failures \n** There is no special handling notes or a similar process in Datacenter to enter any information about DWP's special configuration \n** Chris provided the following text to be sent to customer if needed, they will also try to join the customer meeting as needed \n\"Connectivity from customers to ServiceNow via private exchange such as Equinix involves shared responsibilities.

Here is what we propose: \n \n1) Regarding monitoring and alerting for BGP routing issues, our customers have various methods for connecting to the Equinix backbone to peer with various cloud services, including ServiceNow. Such connections involve multi-supplier architectures with third party links between said cloud services and Equinix itself, and are designed to be sufficiently redundant. ServiceNow monitors continuously for outages from our end of the network, and our systems alert us internally when we see connections going down.  However, ServiceNow's policy is to not alert our customers when single connections go down; because such single-node alerting would flood our customers with frequent alerts where built-in redundancy should avoid any impact to end-users. We will invite our Network Backbone team to the meeting if you would like to discuss this further. \n \n2) Our Network Engineering is also available if you wish to discuss your routing configuration and the diagram provided (ServiceNowLLDDiagram.pdf) in detail. We can invite our network engineers to this meeting if you would like to discuss the technical details or we can arrange a separate meeting between network teams. \n \n3) If you prefer not to consider any changes to your network, we have already documented this issue internally and engineers who receives similar cases in the future will have instructions to prioritise the case with our Network Engineering so that we can present you with a quick analysis and the next steps to solve the issue. \n \nPlease let me know if you have any questions or when you would like to schedule a call. \n \nBest Regards, \nJaba   K k\nwork_notes: SAM Update: \n \nI have a service review at 10:30 with DWP - so will ask for acknowledgement of the last comments and try to confirm a date for a customer facing call with the NOW SMES\nu_hop_notes: HOP rights have been granted to user: Jabagi Kok (NOW)\ncomments: Dear Dan \n \nThank for your time today and, as discussed, you and Dave Rose have been out of the office for the last 4 days, so you said you will catch up with Dave and you will discuss next steps on how you wish to proceed with this case and discussions we wish to have with you. \n \nKind regards \nGregson\nwork_notes: Needs attention flag is manually unset by Jabagi Kok\nwork_notes: Auto-agent: Case moved to automation user based on rules in \"Case - Awaiting Info - Start\" configuration.\nwork_notes: Recent email from SAM (summarising here with 1 sentence from the email): \n----- \nFrom: Gregson Townsend  \nDate: Friday, 30 June 2023 at 01:41 \nSubject: DWP BGP Network Problems and our customer facing statement \nDWP are still not satisfied with the stance we have taken that if there are future BGP or Network/ISP/Equinix issues, we may not be reporting to DWP about the affected connectivity, even if it did not cause a customer outage. \n----- \nNext actions not specified.\nwork_notes: Recent internal email from SAM \n==== \nFrom: Gregson Townsend  \nDate: Friday, 30 June 2023 at 14:39 \nSubject: Re: DWP BGP Network Problems and our customer facing statement \nMy discussions today with Dan Metcalfe, at DWP, were confirmed that they do not wish their Networks team to talk to ours.

You can pass on your previleges to them as I see they all are reporting to you. In case if there are few others who don't report to you, it can be done through their respective managers or the next level manager.\n2. You cal give the access to someone else to approve it on your behalf. This is to ensure your absence isn't blocking anyone else.\n\nI am also providing you the steps to be followed for these options below, please check:\n\nManager Approval: https:/wsocabsent.com/articles/manager-direct-approve.html\nOnbehalf Approval: https:/wsocabsent.com/articles/manager-indirect-approve.html\n\nWarm Regards,\nRoger Seid\nHR Agent, \nPeople Staffing Department,\nShilong - 681210,\nIndia.\n9876293638268\nwww.workspaceoperationcompany.com\n \n\n\n<|end|>\n<|user|>\nThe above case documents an interaction between an agent and a customer.
