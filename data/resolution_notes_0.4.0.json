I appreciate your help, as always.So to confirm, for 2023 I will have:  *   37.5 days carried over from 2022  *   25 PTO days for 2023  *   1 public holiday day carried over from New Years Day 2022  *   TOTAL = 63.5 PTO daysAnd then based on my understanding, I will then need to use or loose all of these days, excluding the 5 I can carry over into 2024, is that right? It s going to be quite difficult to take this many days in one year. I d already started thinking about shortening my mat leave and replacing the final weeks with PTO, so I ll need to do this ASAP if I really will lose the holiday days if I m unable to take them.Thanks,Johnwork_notes: * &nbsp;Processed in WD with comment 'Updating estimated last day of leave to 31/12/2022 as confirmed via HRC0449230' and 'HRC0449230 &amp; HRC0297061'* &nbsp;Payroll Request Raised: &nbsp;FR0261771comments: Hi John, Thank you for confirming. I will get this processed and let you know when complete.  Regarding KIT dates, I received confirmation that these are recorded as 'Other Time Off (Global)' in Workday (in order to generate payment), but they are a working day.  That said, employees aren't eligible for bonus on those days as employees are still on maternity leave during that time (and still recorded as  on leave ). KIT days can only be taken during maternity leave, which essentially take the precedent for bonus eligibility.Thanks!

I will now close out your case but please feel free to reopen and let me know if you require any further support. Have a great rest of your day!HR Agent  Please note, you will receive a survey to complete regarding your HR Case experience with the Global Talent team and would be grateful if you could provide your feedback. Thank you in advance for your time!   comments: reply from: XXXXXXXXXservicenow.comThank you so much HR Agent! I appreciate your help, as always.So to confirm, for 2023 I will have:  *   37.5 days carried over from 2022  *   25 PTO days for 2023  *   1 public holiday day carried over from New Years Day 2022  *   TOTAL = 63.5 PTO daysAnd then based on my understanding, I will then need to use or loose all of these days, excluding the 5 I can carry over into 2024, is that right? It s going to be quite difficult to take this many days in one year. I d already started thinking about shortening my mat leave and replacing the final weeks with PTO, so I ll need to do this ASAP if I really will lose the holiday days if I m unable to take them.Thanks,Johnwork_notes: * &nbsp;Processed in WD with comment 'Updating estimated last day of leave to 31/12/2022 as confirmed via HRC0449230' and 'HRC0449230 &amp; HRC0297061'* &nbsp;Payroll Request Raised: &nbsp;FR0261771comments: Hi John, Thank you for confirming. I will get this processed and let you know when complete.  Regarding KIT dates, I received confirmation that these are recorded as 'Other Time Off (Global)' in Workday (in order to generate payment), but they are a working day.  That said, employees aren't eligible for bonus on those days as employees are still on maternity leave during that time (and still recorded as  on leave ). KIT days can only be taken during maternity leave, which essentially take the precedent for bonus eligibility.Thanks!

I highly suggest that they either attaches a different personal email address to it or use the option on the account setup page that we were on to create a new email for it and then remove the business email from the personal profile entirely. I have seen this kind of set up cause nothing but problems. Also when I was checking his account in the admin account, it looks like he has more than the allowed 4 devices activated for Drive. I would check with the user to see if some of those can be removed.    Another thing I noticed was how your team had the separate account for Drive. Is that where users store shared files? I would suggest, instead of doing that, migrating those files into Drive. It will surely make the management and sharing of those files easier. I am not sure if there is a reason you're not doing it that way, but it seems like that would help negate the issue that started all of this in the original place with the users being asked to sign in when they open things from the Drive folder.comments: Hello Mike,I have got the access to delete this personal profile.

    "response": "The agent and the customer were discussing an issue where a policy was set to ignore a drive on all computers but the drive is still being scanned by Fortinet. The agent provided a solution by explaining that the exclusions won't apply in a manual scan. Instead, the agent suggested that the user run a full scan from the GUI on the endpoint or right-click a file or folder and select scan with BEST. The agent also noted that scheduled scans will apply the exclusions. However, the agent acknowledged that there may be an issue with device scans not applying the custom exclusions and stated that they would issue a ticket with Fortinet to troubleshoot and identify a better way to ignore the drive. The agent also noted that the users are not running manual scans and asked whether a device scan initiated by plugging a removable drive in is considered a manual scan. The agent then closed the ticket, stating that they had disabled device scanning.",

    "golden resolution notes": "      S o l u t i o n   P r o p o s e d Hello Pedro,     My name is Camilo Arenas Amaya, and I am more than glad assisting you with your Case. I would like to confirm the following is correct for the issue you are currently facing:   Issue:  How to delete data from DeloitteEDP2 instance: Attachments and Notifications  Business Impact : Medium as it is a requirement   Description:   You would like to know if there is a way to delete all that attachments and notifications created at or before 01-08-2016, without running a fix script that will take some time to do it.  Does ServiceNow has a more efficient way to do this, or only by fix script?  Investigation Summary:   Please find our overarching guide to mass deletion in KB0717791. It provides the answer to your questions and the available options in ServiceNow: KB0717791 Mass-Deletion and Excess Data Management Recommendations  This article outlines several methods for deletion, each with their own pros and cons. Based on your particular request, the best option for getting this done is most likely the last one on the list, 'Deleting with JavaScript'. I assume that based on the requirement that suggests you only need to execute the deletion just once after cloning and not on a regular basis but of course feel free to choose the method that suits you the most.  For your encoded query, I would recommend batching chunks of your desired tables, rather than building a query with all of them at once. You can obtain a properly-formatted encoded query by right-clicking the Filter Breadcrumb in a list view and selecting 'Copy query'. https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/tokyo-platform-user-interface/page/use/using-lists/task/t_GenEncodQueryStringFilter.html#t_GenEncodQueryStringFilter  This would allow you to build out a few chunks and run them in order, breaking up the effort as needed.  To support this effort, it's recommended to have the following 3 indexes on the affected notification and attachment tables:   sys_created_on   tablename, sys_created_on   tablename, fieldname, sys_created_on  As it targets specific records based on the encoded query, I believe it should work for this purpose - I understand your concern that scripting is not a viable solution for this effort due to the size of your tables.  Due to ServiceNow policy, it is highly recommended that you as customer are the one to delete data records due to the usual risks involved  Next steps: We are placing it in Solution Proposed. Please review the above information and if you are comfortable with the information which has been provided, please consider closing this Case by clicking on Accept Solution. Otherwise, please let me know any additional questions or concerns you may have as well.

At any time in the Solution Proposed state, you may add additional questions or updates.    Issue:  You are not able to install Log Export Service (LES) 2.0.1 on your instances, see screenshots attached.

    "golden resolution notes": "   Hello Antoine,  It was nice talking with you over the zoom.   As discussed we are moving the case to the solution proposed.   The Solution for the case is:  As discussed in the call, instead of individually checking for the dependent value and using the client script to update the sub-category field, you can use \"dependent_value= current.variables.category\" to make the process dynamic.  In order to ensure a smooth transition of the values add \"ref_qual_elements=category;\" as a variable attribute on the subcategory variable and the issue is resolved.  We have tested the solution provided in the zoom meeting and observed the issue is fixed.   Please update the case if you have any additional questions.   I am setting this case to Solution Proposed, if I have answered your question please \"Accept Solution\" and take the survey.  If I have not answered your question you may \"Reject Solution\" anytime and we can continue to work together towards a solution.

For more details regarding this process, please review the KB0519074-How to request access to customer's instances  If there's no correlation between the Source Company and the Target Company in the Now Support Portal, access to the records in the source will be lost once moved to the target.   ServiceNow will be changing the IP addresses associated with all customer instances. If the source company has applied restrictions or filters on the IP address associated with the instances, it will be required to whitelist \"Virtual IP (VIP)\" addresses and \"Network Address Translation (NAT)\" to access the ServiceNow instances without interruption, after the migration. For more information, kindly refer to : https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0596772   Next Steps:    Please let me know if you have any other queries, I'll be happy to assist you.  ***  As part of the troubleshooting process, I and other ServiceNow personnel may need to access your instance(s) in order to review the service impact to your instance and determine the root cause. It may also be necessary to make some changes on a sub-production instance in order to troubleshoot the issue or to test a probable solution. These changes, if any, will be reverted back to the original state. If any change is not reverted a reason will be provided for the same.  If you need immediate assistance, please use one of the contact numbers from our support contact page: http://www.servicenow.com/support/contact-support.html You will then be able to enter your Case or Change number over the phone to have your call routed to the Support Team.

The process to have a customer pentest request prior to submitting the Security Findings. Please note that you'll need to map the security findings that you raise with this CPT request number once you have the report ready. 2. EACH issue/finding should be reported in English with Steps to Reproduce as well as any supporting evidence (i.e. screenshots and or videos). Here is the link using which you can submit a security finding from your instance/HI portal https://support.servicenow.com/now?id=form&table=u_security_finding&sys_id=-1 3. To submit each finding individually including a detailed report of the issue with steps to manually reproduce the issue. A single submission containing an attached report file containing multiple findings will not be processed. Scanner-generated issues are prone to false positives and will not be reviewed by ServiceNow until the issue is \"Manually\" reproduced. 4. For more info, please refer to the FAQ https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0953526  Regarding your concerns, please see our comments below:  1) Web Application Firewall (WAF) Detected - Companies should consider implementing a web application firewall that can protect against common web vulnerabilities, such as SQL Injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). Many hosting providers offer WAF capabilities as well. - URL:https://community.orbussoftware.com/community    Web Application Firewall (WAF) is not currently in place given the nature of the ServiceNow platform architecture. Because of the nature of the ServiceNow platform, a WAF implementation would be highly complex and might result in blocking legitimate traffic due to the myriad ways ServiceNow instances are used by customers. In the absence of a WAF, ServiceNow has implemented compensating controls that customers can manage within their instance.  ServiceNow has performed significant testing using WAF capabilities across the platform that resulted in severe performance and availability impacts to instances. After tuning WAF protections to eliminate the negative impacts, the resulting security enhancements were determined to be minimal at best. Security controls already built into customer instances via the Instance Security Center are available to customers to provide greater protection levels than a ServiceNow-managed WAF due to the various use cases in how customers configure and use their instances. Many of these controls help protect against OWASP Top Ten and other attacks. Additionally, customers have the ability to adopt third-party WAF solutions, such as Cloudflare, if the presence of a WAF is a mandatory requirement.  2) Website does not implement X-XSS-Protection Best Practices - Add the following header to responses from this website: 'X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block' - URL:https://community.orbussoftware.com/community    Due to the customizability of the platform, ServiceNow has decided not to implement the X-XSS protection header out of the box and instead relies on other mitigations for XSS protection. ServiceNow allows customers to extend the platform in numerous ways that could be impacted by setting this header out of the box. ServiceNow performs input validation in the form of input escaping and output encoding for JS, HTML, NG and Jelly technologies. A combinational approach is used based on the usage and nature of the data being consumed by the application. The platform has configurations in the form of system properties that controls the security behaviour for Input Validations and Database operations. You can find these configurations via ServiceNow Instance Hardening. Specifically, information about the HTML Sanitizer can be found here: https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=c_HTMLSanitizer.html&version=platform.  For more information on this please see the following resources - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-XSS-Protection - https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/HTTP_Headers_Cheat_Sheet.html  3) Content Security Policy Contains Broad Directives - Explicitly specify trusted sources for your script-src and object-src policies. Ideally, you can use the 'self' directive to limit scripts and objects to only those on your own domain, or you can explicitly specify domains that you trust and rely upon for your site to function. - URL:https://community.orbussoftware.com/community    Given the flexible nature of the platform, each customer's use cases will be unique, and one value for the Content-Security-Policy (CSP) header may work well for one customer but may impact another customer. As such ServiceNow does not set this header out of the box.   If your security team feels this header is necessary to be set, your instance administrators can configure HTTP response headers for all, or specific types of pages, which include Service Portal, UI Page, or UX applications. More information on this can be found via the platform documentation found here:   https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=http-response-header.html&version=servicenow https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=configure-http-response-header.html&version=servicenow   When implementing the CSP header, certain values may cause a significant impact on the usability of the instance. In some cases, the instance may be prevented from rendering in your browser. If you have a requirement to implement the CSP header, please ensure to test the header value in a sub-production environment prior to promoting the configuration to your production environment.   Finally, if you experience a significant impact as a result of setting the CSP header, please open a case to support to assist you in reverting the value.

Below is our Customer Instance Security Testing | Policy and Procedure, please take time to read and understand it before submitting the findings which will help you know all about this program and process.  - https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0538598 - https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1119943  Please note: 1. The process to have a customer pentest request prior to submitting the Security Findings. Please note that you'll need to map the security findings that you raise with this CPT request number once you have the report ready. 2. EACH issue/finding should be reported in English with Steps to Reproduce as well as any supporting evidence (i.e. screenshots and or videos). Here is the link using which you can submit a security finding from your instance/HI portal https://support.servicenow.com/now?id=form&table=u_security_finding&sys_id=-1 3. To submit each finding individually including a detailed report of the issue with steps to manually reproduce the issue. A single submission containing an attached report file containing multiple findings will not be processed. Scanner-generated issues are prone to false positives and will not be reviewed by ServiceNow until the issue is \"Manually\" reproduced. 4. For more info, please refer to the FAQ https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0953526  Regarding your concerns, please see our comments below:  1) Web Application Firewall (WAF) Detected - Companies should consider implementing a web application firewall that can protect against common web vulnerabilities, such as SQL Injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). Many hosting providers offer WAF capabilities as well. - URL:https://community.orbussoftware.com/community    Web Application Firewall (WAF) is not currently in place given the nature of the ServiceNow platform architecture. Because of the nature of the ServiceNow platform, a WAF implementation would be highly complex and might result in blocking legitimate traffic due to the myriad ways ServiceNow instances are used by customers. In the absence of a WAF, ServiceNow has implemented compensating controls that customers can manage within their instance.  ServiceNow has performed significant testing using WAF capabilities across the platform that resulted in severe performance and availability impacts to instances. After tuning WAF protections to eliminate the negative impacts, the resulting security enhancements were determined to be minimal at best. Security controls already built into customer instances via the Instance Security Center are available to customers to provide greater protection levels than a ServiceNow-managed WAF due to the various use cases in how customers configure and use their instances. Many of these controls help protect against OWASP Top Ten and other attacks. Additionally, customers have the ability to adopt third-party WAF solutions, such as Cloudflare, if the presence of a WAF is a mandatory requirement.  2) Website does not implement X-XSS-Protection Best Practices - Add the following header to responses from this website: 'X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block' - URL:https://community.orbussoftware.com/community    Due to the customizability of the platform, ServiceNow has decided not to implement the X-XSS protection header out of the box and instead relies on other mitigations for XSS protection. ServiceNow allows customers to extend the platform in numerous ways that could be impacted by setting this header out of the box. ServiceNow performs input validation in the form of input escaping and output encoding for JS, HTML, NG and Jelly technologies. A combinational approach is used based on the usage and nature of the data being consumed by the application. The platform has configurations in the form of system properties that controls the security behaviour for Input Validations and Database operations. You can find these configurations via ServiceNow Instance Hardening. Specifically, information about the HTML Sanitizer can be found here: https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=c_HTMLSanitizer.html&version=platform.  For more information on this please see the following resources - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-XSS-Protection - https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/HTTP_Headers_Cheat_Sheet.html  3) Content Security Policy Contains Broad Directives - Explicitly specify trusted sources for your script-src and object-src policies. Ideally, you can use the 'self' directive to limit scripts and objects to only those on your own domain, or you can explicitly specify domains that you trust and rely upon for your site to function. - URL:https://community.orbussoftware.com/community    Given the flexible nature of the platform, each customer's use cases will be unique, and one value for the Content-Security-Policy (CSP) header may work well for one customer but may impact another customer. As such ServiceNow does not set this header out of the box.  If your security team feels this header is necessary to be set, your instance administrators can configure HTTP response headers for all, or specific types of pages, which include Service Portal, UI Page, or UX applications. More information on this can be found via the platform documentation found here:  https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=http-response-header.html&version=servicenow https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=configure-http-response-header.html&version=servicenow  When implementing the CSP header, certain values may cause a significant impact on the usability of the instance. In some cases, the instance may be prevented from rendering in your browser. If you have a requirement to implement the CSP header, please ensure to test the header value in a sub-production environment prior to promoting the configuration to your production environment.  Finally, if you experience a significant impact as a result of setting the CSP header, please open a case to support to assist you in reverting the value.

Please add your updates to this ticket if I can help clarify the following summary.  ISSUE SUMMARY: ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Javascript errors showing in project workspace  MOST PROBABLE CAUSE: ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Upon further review, this is an expected behavior. User 'Waymo Project Viewer' does not have sufficient roles to be able to access the planning console which is why the error message is thrown. On your test instance, we see that the project workspace module has been customized to allow users with the 'waymo_project_viewer' role to access this module, but this does not grant them access to make use of the planning console.  Per our documentation, a user with the 'it_project_manager' is required to 'Access the planning console to perform the planning for the project'    Please see the following production documentation: I. Open the project planning console: https://docs.servicenow.com/en-US/bundle/utah-it-business-management/page/product/project-management/task/t_OpenPlanningConsole.html  For more details regarding the roles installed with the PPM standard plugin, please refer to the following documentation II. Installed with PPM Standard (Project Portfolio Management): https://docs.servicenow.com/en-US/bundle/utah-it-business-management/page/product/project-portfolio-suite-with-financials/reference/r_InstalledWithProjectPortfolioSuiteWithFinancials.html  SOLUTION PROPOSED: ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *Please test and validate the following solution on a sub-prod instance to ensure that everything is working as expected before making any changes to your production instance*  To resolve this issue, please grant the user 'Waymo Project Viewer' the 'it_project_manager' user role. I have done this on your 'test' instance and the issue was not longer occurring.  After my testing, I removed the role from this user's account.  NEXT STEPS: ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Before rejecting the solution, please update the case with any questions or concerns you have regarding the solution I have provided. If any further clarification is needed, please provide me with your availability, and I can set up a zoom call to answer any more questions that you have.

The results you are seeing are expected. Between the different datasources of Service Graph Connectors and our Discovery product, and how the data is collected and in turn transformed is expected to be different for these software models associated to the OS builds you are seeing in excess to what Discovery is using.  In the interim, if the excess models are causing reporting issues, we would recommend that you use the reconciliation rules to pick a \"source of truth\" between the datasources, and only authorize that datasource to update the respective attributes for the OS install.  The original design of the multi-source CMDB with Discovery and CMDB in use together was that the Software Asset Management plugin will be indifferent on the differences in the software models due to the fact that they should all be normalizing to the same normalized together in a asset software licensing sense.    We are aware of these discrepancies of the values and our internal teams have been evaluating if we plan on normalizing all of these; and if so when. We will relay any relevant information/timeline.   - Please let us know if you would like to discuss any of what was provided, and we will get a meeting scheduled.  Regards, Seancomments: Hello Dakota,  I miss typed the first sentence in the 3rd paragraph. It should read as: The original design of the multi-source CMDB with Discovery and Service Graph Connectors in use together was that the Software Asset Management plugin will be indifferent on the differences in the software models, this is due to the fact that they should all be normalizing to the normalized product  in a asset software licensing sense.  Regards, Seancomments: I don't think I mentioned software or models or software models in my case so far. I don't think I mentioned SAM either.  Our concerns are about the variation in Operating System values from Tanium Asset SGC (the \"os\" field on \"cmdb_ci_computer\" table). Our concern is if we run Tanium Asset SGC, it will fill in Operating System with values that are not consistent with Discovery or other Service Graph Connectors.  We have IRE in place and have a great deal of experience with it. I even have a knowledge article I wrote for our users that explains our reconciliation definitions (basically the order of \"precedence\" for each Discovery Source) https://pdsm.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB000224310  The Operating System field is a very important field for reporting and CMDB processes. We use \"Linux Red Hat\" specifically for Linux Patch Status calculation (use Operating System + OS Version + Kernel Release to populate a custom Patch Status field). We only calculate for Linux Red Hat, no other Linux variants. Tanium seems to be bringing in an entirely new set of operating systems unlike anything we have seen before, and it would cause disruption for reporting and Linux Patch Status calculation (at least) if Tanium started updating Operating System on devices where the highest priority Discovery Source is Tanium. Please look at my text from 2023-05-22 and notice how incredibly different Tanium would be providing Operating System for Linux devices. ServiceNow Discovery just puts \"Linux Red Hat\" (as long as it is actually red hat) and lets the numbers go into OS Version.  If we place Tanium Asset SGC higher priority over other sources (which would be consistent with how we have treated SCCM SGC and Intune SGC) it could take ownership of that field for a lot of CIs and drastically change the data landscape for Operating System. Even if we put it with the same priority we put to our existing custom Tanium integration, it would still be disruptive due to how different the Operating System data is.work_notes: Moved to Sean who is working on the case.u_hop_notes: HOP rights have been granted to user: Catherine Isaacs (NOW)u_hop_notes: HOP rights have been granted to user: Sean Webster (NOW)work_notes: Assigned To Changed.Special Handling Notes:DO NOT RECORD ZOOM MEETINGS!DO NOT RECORD ZOOM MEETINGS!

Customer asked to increase priority to 2 now and asking for an update.  I am not sure if you have seen this from customer on 6/29  *******  I don't think I mentioned software or models or software models in my case so far. I don't think I mentioned SAM either.  Our concerns are about the variation in Operating System values from Tanium Asset SGC (the \"os\" field on \"cmdb_ci_computer\" table). Our concern is if we run Tanium Asset SGC, it will fill in Operating System with values that are not consistent with Discovery or other Service Graph Connectors.  We have IRE in place and have a great deal of experience with it. I even have a knowledge article I wrote for our users that explains our reconciliation definitions (basically the order of \"precedence\" for each Discovery Source) https://pdsm.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB000224310  The Operating System field is a very important field for reporting and CMDB processes. We use \"Linux Red Hat\" specifically for Linux Patch Status calculation (use Operating System + OS Version + Kernel Release to populate a custom Patch Status field). We only calculate for Linux Red Hat, no other Linux variants. Tanium seems to be bringing in an entirely new set of operating systems unlike anything we have seen before, and it would cause disruption for reporting and Linux Patch Status calculation (at least) if Tanium started updating Operating System on devices where the highest priority Discovery Source is Tanium. Please look at my text from 2023-05-22 and notice how incredibly different Tanium would be providing Operating System for Linux devices. ServiceNow Discovery just puts \"Linux Red Hat\" (as long as it is actually red hat) and lets the numbers go into OS Version.  If we place Tanium Asset SGC higher priority over other sources (which would be consistent with how we have treated SCCM SGC and Intune SGC) it could take ownership of that field for a lot of CIs and drastically change the data landscape for Operating System. Even if we put it with the same priority we put to our existing custom Tanium integration, it would still be disruptive due to how different the Operating System data is.work_notes: Auto-agent: Case moved to automation user based on rules in \"Case - Need task completion - Start\" configuration.work_notes: CSTASK579542 (CS - Integrations) Task notes  updated by now.autoagentAuto-agent: This is an automated reminder that this task is pending your update.

It is updating the OS to a new value as seen in attached screenshot.   OS value is derived by below SG-Tanium operation. You can see that it takes \"operating_system\" as input and outputs \"u_converted_operating_system\" through the \"Cleanse Operating System\" operation.  https://fedexdev01.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=sn_cmdb_int_util_cleanse_os_operation.do?sys_id=daa9a5fa532830106747ddeeff7b1236 https://fedexdev01.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=sys_rte_eb_operation_type.do?sys_id=02586738735500102b6265a751ab9e63  The source data has operating_system as \"Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 7.9 (Maipo)\" and this operation returns the cleansed operating system as \"Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 7.9 (Maipo)\" and that directly goes to the OS field on the CI.   If you trace the script you will arrive at below code which is checking if the operating_system passed to it exists in sys_choice or not. When it does not find one it insert one and when it finds one it reuses it.   https://fedexdev01.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=sys_script_include.do?sys_id=5107787137203000dcd48c00dfbe5da7  SG-Tanium should send \"Linux Red Hat\" instead of \"Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 7.9 (Maipo)\". Looks like other discovery sources send it as \"Linux Red Hat\" and it works for them.

Customer asked to increase priority to 2 now and asking for an update.  I am not sure if you have seen this from customer on 6/29  *******  I don't think I mentioned software or models or software models in my case so far. I don't think I mentioned SAM either.  Our concerns are about the variation in Operating System values from Tanium Asset SGC (the \"os\" field on \"cmdb_ci_computer\" table). Our concern is if we run Tanium Asset SGC, it will fill in Operating System with values that are not consistent with Discovery or other Service Graph Connectors.  We have IRE in place and have a great deal of experience with it. I even have a knowledge article I wrote for our users that explains our reconciliation definitions (basically the order of \"precedence\" for each Discovery Source) https://pdsm.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB000224310  The Operating System field is a very important field for reporting and CMDB processes. We use \"Linux Red Hat\" specifically for Linux Patch Status calculation (use Operating System + OS Version + Kernel Release to populate a custom Patch Status field). We only calculate for Linux Red Hat, no other Linux variants. Tanium seems to be bringing in an entirely new set of operating systems unlike anything we have seen before, and it would cause disruption for reporting and Linux Patch Status calculation (at least) if Tanium started updating Operating System on devices where the highest priority Discovery Source is Tanium. Please look at my text from 2023-05-22 and notice how incredibly different Tanium would be providing Operating System for Linux devices. ServiceNow Discovery just puts \"Linux Red Hat\" (as long as it is actually red hat) and lets the numbers go into OS Version.  If we place Tanium Asset SGC higher priority over other sources (which would be consistent with how we have treated SCCM SGC and Intune SGC) it could take ownership of that field for a lot of CIs and drastically change the data landscape for Operating System. Even if we put it with the same priority we put to our existing custom Tanium integration, it would still be disruptive due to how different the Operating System data is.work_notes: Auto-agent: Case moved to automation user based on rules in \"Case - Need task completion - Start\" configuration.work_notes: CSTASK579542 (CS - Integrations) Task notes  updated by now.autoagentAuto-agent: This is an automated reminder that this task is pending your update.

    "response": "The case was resolved by the agent sharing information with the customer about the issue and its resolution.  The agent provided details about the discrepancies between Tanium Asset SGC operating systems and ServiceNow Discovery, JAMF SGC, and suggested using reconciliation rules to pick a \"source of truth\" between the datasources.  They also explained that the original design of the multi-source CMDB with Discovery and CMDB in use together was that the Software Asset Management plugin will be indifferent on the differences in the software models due to the fact that they should all be normalizing to the same normalized together in a asset software licensing sense.  Finally, they recommended that the customer work with Tanium on the issue.",
    "golden resolution notes": "   Hello Dakota,  I hope you doing well and I really apologize for the delay.  We have received update from our internal Team.  The OS field is updated by different discovery sources but SG-Tanium is breaking the format. It is updating the OS to a new value as seen in attached screenshot.  OS value is derived by below SG-Tanium operation. You can see that it takes \"operating_system\" as input and outputs \"u_converted_operating_system\" through the \"Cleanse Operating System\" operation.  https://fedexdev01.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=sn_cmdb_int_util_cleanse_os_operation.do?sys_id=daa9a5fa532830106747ddeeff7b1236 https://fedexdev01.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=sys_rte_eb_operation_type.do?sys_id=02586738735500102b6265a751ab9e63  The source data has operating_system as \"Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 7.9 (Maipo)\" and this operation returns the cleansed operating system as \"Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 7.9 (Maipo)\" and that directly goes to the OS field on the CI.  If you trace the script you will arrive at below code which is checking if the operating_system passed to it exists in sys_choice or not. When it does not find one it insert one and when it finds one it reuses it.  https://fedexdev01.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=sys_script_include.do?sys_id=5107787137203000dcd48c00dfbe5da7  SG-Tanium should send \"Linux Red Hat\" instead of \"Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 7.9 (Maipo)\".  Looks like other discovery sources send it as \"Linux Red Hat\" and it works for them.  Action Plan: Please contact Tanium Support to work on this.  With this information I am placing this incident into \"Solution Proposed\"status.  Should you not have any other questions on this, please accpet the solution proposed.  Please note that once the case is closed, you may receive a survey for this incident, evaluating the way this incident has been handled. We would really appreciate your feedback.  Your satisfaction is our top priority.   Otherwise, please do not hesitate to get back to me with any other questions you may have on this, that I may gladly answer.

    "context": "A case was opened with a short description of Email Reader Not Working as ExpectedA longer description includes This afternoon we discovered issues with our production mailbox used for ServiceNow inbound and outbound emailing. At the time of discovery, around 4pm CST, there were over 170 unread (unprocessed) emails.Email connectivity has not been disrupted in any sense and the OAuth token is not set to expire around this time. After logging into the mailbox manually (O365), we also noticed that it was not deleting emails after they were being processed by ServiceNow. Instead, they remained 'read' and did not get deleted.We have had a similar issue before, but the cause was never identified by ServiceNow. We checked with our Office 365 administrators and they were able to confirm that the mailbox was able to receive and send mail throughout the day, has had no licensing changes, nor any other changes done to it. The issue seems to be with a component within ServiceNow.We have processed all of the unread emails, but in order to do so, we were forced to manually kick off the 'Email Reader' job, and once it was done, we then deleted the batch of emails it read/processed manually ourselves because it was not doing so automatically. We repeated this process about a dozen times or more until everything was read and processed in the mailbox.After the final batch of emails was processed manually (with the help of the reader job), the mailbox's entire inbox was cleared and as a test, we wanted to see what would happen, but the issue remains. When we visit the 'Email Diagnostics' page, it will occasionally say that email sending is non-operational, but will retain its status of 'active' and 'enabled' across the board, with one of the stats showing high processing time (upwards of 40,000ms). This issue appears to have started yesterday at some point, and even with these issues, outbound email remained functional and responsive. The primary issue as it stands now is that the mailbox has to be maintained manually, else emails are not being processed automatically.

Solution Proposed:  As emails with the same message ID are in the mailbox, the first one is removed and the rest are left as is and not processed. Please check what/who is generating the email and fix the email generation. The instance should process them properly afterwards. The issue is with the emails and not the instance.

I understand that you would like to have more information regarding the agenda for the proposed meeting. Here is what we propose:  1) Regarding monitoring and alerting for BGP routing issues, our customers have various methods for connecting to the Equinix backbone to peer with various cloud services, including ServiceNow. Such connections involve multi-supplier architectures with third party links between said cloud services and Equinix itself, and are designed to be sufficiently redundant. ServiceNow monitors continuously for outages from our end of the network, and our systems alert us internally when we see connections going down.  However, ServiceNow's policy is to not alert our customers when single connections go down; because such single-node alerting would flood our customers with frequent alerts where built-in redundancy should avoid any impact to end-users. We will invite our Network Backbone team to the meeting if you would like to discuss this further.  2) Our Network Engineering is also available if you wish to discuss your routing configuration and the diagram provided (ServiceNowLLDDiagram.pdf) in detail. We can invite our network engineers to this meeting if you would like to discuss the technical details or we can arrange a separate meeting between network teams.  3) If you prefer not to consider any changes to your network, we have already documented this issue internally and engineers who receives similar cases in the future will have instructions to prioritise the case with our Network Engineering so that we can present you with a quick analysis and the next steps to solve the issue.  Please let me know if you have any questions or when you would like to schedule a call.

As such ServiceNow cannot maintain sole responsibility for ECX peering's. ServiceNow continues to recommend that for ECX peering issues customers create cases with Equinix, ServiceNow, and any third parties customers might use for connection to Equinix.\" * Updated the SHN for DWP in HI and added information on how to handle future BGP issues.

I understand that you would like to have more information regarding the agenda for the proposed meeting. Here is what we propose:  1) Regarding monitoring and alerting for BGP routing issues, our customers have various methods for connecting to the Equinix backbone to peer with various cloud services, including ServiceNow. Such connections involve multi-supplier architectures with third party links between said cloud services and Equinix itself, and are designed to be sufficiently redundant. ServiceNow monitors continuously for outages from our end of the network, and our systems alert us internally when we see connections going down.  However, ServiceNow's policy is to not alert our customers when single connections go down; because such single-node alerting would flood our customers with frequent alerts where built-in redundancy should avoid any impact to end-users. We will invite our Network Backbone team to the meeting if you would like to discuss this further.  2) Our Network Engineering is also available if you wish to discuss your routing configuration and the diagram provided (ServiceNowLLDDiagram.pdf) in detail. We can invite our network engineers to this meeting if you would like to discuss the technical details or we can arrange a separate meeting between network teams.  3) If you prefer not to consider any changes to your network, we have already documented this issue internally and engineers who receives similar cases in the future will have instructions to prioritise the case with our Network Engineering so that we can present you with a quick analysis and the next steps to solve the issue.  Please let me know if you have any questions or when you would like to schedule a call.

Dan said that he knows that their Network team will not accept the invite and that there may not be any profit to any such discussions. Dan said that the Special Handling Notes we have in place should suffice and he said that DWP staff can guide NOW teams to review the SHN, if it is not being followed, in the event of a network/BGP issue. Dan will try and meet up with Mark Bell before the meeting with Jordi next week, to let him know of our discussion this morning.

No  REASON: Original request is for INT (Table Administration and Data Management) and not admin. Customer might ask for additional questions relating to specific tables.  NEXT STEPS: Queries about the Database dump can be answered by the customer-facing article (KB1123074).  1. How long will it take to receive the ServiceNow database dump if the request is placed on 08/07? Ans: We will perform the database dump no later than 30 days after the instance has been retired.   2. Confirmation is needed on the format of the exported database dump. Ans: Contractually, ServiceNow will provide the customer with a copy of their database in an industry standard format once they are EOL. From here it's expected that the customer will take that copy and operate on it as needed. ServiceNow does not have the process or resourcing to provide assistance after a DB dump has been provided to the customer.  3. Please confirm the size of the ServiceNow database dump. Ans: Customers will be able to see the exact amount of data when the data dump has been delivered to them.  4. Will the database dump be provided as a complete export in a single file or split into multiple smaller chunks? Ans: Database dump will be provided in one single file.  5. Will the database dump be compressed to reduce file size? Ans: The DB dump will be provided in our SFTP server only. The SFTP file will be an exact snapshot of customer's instance.  6. Do we need to specify a storage location(AWS S3) for the ServiceNow team to copy the database dump? Ans: Customer can extract the database dump file from SFTP Server using FileZilla Software.  7. Will the exported database dump be encrypted to ensure data security during transportation and storage? Ans: SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) is a file transfer protocol that leverages a set of utilities that provide secure access to a remote computer to deliver secure communications. It is considered by many to be the optimal method for secure file transfer. Can easily defend any brute force attacks.  8. If needed, can we request incremental exports to receive only the data changes since the last export? Ans: The customer is entitled to only one dump once the retirement has been requested. It is recommended that we provide the DB dump close to their decommissioning date so they get all the data they had up to that point to avoid creating multiple DB dumps.  For further information, customers can refer to the below KB article. https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sys_kb_id=40bff9fb471fa550a330b98a436d43e3work_notes: The blocking task CSTASK626208 with blocking reason Need Task Completion is closed by Leah Barrameda (NOW)u_hop_notes: HOP rights have been granted to user: James Smith (NOW)u_hop_notes: HOP rights have been granted to user: Mathankumar Rangasamy (NOW)work_notes: CSTASK626208 (CS - Administration) Task notes  updated by mathankumar.r@Leah Barrameda (NOW) Thanks for the update, customer so far has asked queries about how to extract data dump and we have not received any query specific to a table.

STEPS TAKEN: - Impersonated customer and confirmed they have clicked on 'get' from the store and they're getting the 'Ready to Install' button greyed out. - Requested customer to share screenshot of the 'all applications' page loading and to confirm the length of time the page is taking to load and also confirm if this issue is reproducible in multiple browsers in order to assist with investigating the issue further.

What happens is: we click on  Plugins  and an empty form appears and it stays empty until we manually close the browser. This looks to be indefinite.   It happens in multiple browsers. BTW, we are using Microsoft Edge.   In the O-instance no issues with opening the Plugins page.comments: Some additional information in the attached screenshots (from developer tools in Edge)  The message \"you have been redirected to All Applications. To see the Plugins list click here\" does appear. The table v_plugin is shown after clicking on the link in the message. When you close the message only the Loading text is shown  And or what it's worth, opening sys_plugin.list and sys_scope.list from the navigator works fine.

We are familiar with the process of retrieving plugins for an on-prem installation without internet connection.I have tried the alternative path, but at no success. I can navigate and open the form but it stays empty and does not show the list of applications.This is similar what is happening to the Plugins form.

What happens is: we click on  Plugins  and an empty form appears and it stays empty until we manually close the browser. This looks to be indefinite.   It happens in multiple browsers. BTW, we are using Microsoft Edge.   In the O-instance no issues with opening the Plugins page.comments: Some additional information in the attached screenshots (from developer tools in Edge)  The message \"you have been redirected to All Applications. To see the Plugins list click here\" does appear. The table v_plugin is shown after clicking on the link in the message. When you close the message only the Loading text is shown  And or what it's worth, opening sys_plugin.list and sys_scope.list from the navigator works fine. Both lists open within 1 second, but these lists doesn't give the actions like  'Find in store' or 'Request Plugin'work_notes: @Salim Kassongo (NOW), The customer has escalated the case and looking for an update, I understand this is an on-prem solution, I guess you have the necessary screenshots below, can you please expedite the case and next steps.comments: Hello Ron,  My name is Norma Robles and I am I am a Customer Support Team Lead with ServiceNow.

We are familiar with the process of retrieving plugins for an on-prem installation without internet connection.I have tried the alternative path, but at no success. I can navigate and open the form but it stays empty and does not show the list of applications.This is similar what is happening to the Plugins form.

[External facing comments] For information on ServiceNow's position around the implementation of a WAF, please review the following: Web Application Firewall (WAF) are not currently in place given the nature of the ServiceNow platform architecture and offering. Because of the nature of the ServiceNow platform, a WAF implementation would be highly complex and might result in blocking legitimate traffic due to the myriad ways ServiceNow instances are used by customers. In the absence of a WAF, ServiceNow has implemented compensating controls that customers can manage within their instance.  ServiceNow has performed significant testing using WAF capabilities across the platform that resulted in severe performance and availability impacts to instances. After tuning WAF protections to eliminate the negative impacts, the resulting security enhancements were determined to be minimal at best.  Security controls already built into customer instances via the Instance Security Center are available to customers to provide greater protection levels than a ServiceNow managed WAF due to the various use-cases in how customers configure and use their instances. Many of these controls help protect against OWASP Top Ten and other attacks. Additionally, customers have the ability to adopt third-party WAF solutions, such as Cloudflare, if the presence of a WAF is a mandatory requirement.    Additionally, The nature of ServiceNow makes it resistant to SQLi as no direct SQL access is allowed to the database and all SQL statements are mediated by the application. ServiceNow also undergoes hundred of penetration tests per year testing for vulnerabilities such as SQL injection as we allow all customers to perform a free penetration test against their sub-production instances annually as well as hire third-party penetration testing companies to perform a penetration test ahead of every major family release. ServiceNow runs IDS infrastructure that detects for common attacks such as XSS and SQLi.

As per their suggestion, has Platform Technologies been engaged on this topic for any additional hardening suggestions they might have for Virtual Agent?  Ultimately any time a customer has guest user access to their platform there will be instances where guest users may attempt to test some security functions like an SQL injection type scenario. As mentioned previously ServiceNow has a number of controls in place to protect itself from these common attacks including a Secure Development Lifecycle with DAST/SAST testing, no direct SQL access to the database with it all being mediated by the platform and if customers wish to they can change viewing permissions to who has access to the virtual agent to prevent access to guest users if this is a huge concern.   After investigation by ServiceNow's security team, they have highlighted activity which we encourage the customer to investigate themselves as we cannot determine who is a legitimate user or not.

[External facing comments] For information on ServiceNow's position around the implementation of a WAF, please review the following: Web Application Firewall (WAF) are not currently in place given the nature of the ServiceNow platform architecture and offering. Because of the nature of the ServiceNow platform, a WAF implementation would be highly complex and might result in blocking legitimate traffic due to the myriad ways ServiceNow instances are used by customers. In the absence of a WAF, ServiceNow has implemented compensating controls that customers can manage within their instance.  ServiceNow has performed significant testing using WAF capabilities across the platform that resulted in severe performance and availability impacts to instances. After tuning WAF protections to eliminate the negative impacts, the resulting security enhancements were determined to be minimal at best.  Security controls already built into customer instances via the Instance Security Center are available to customers to provide greater protection levels than a ServiceNow managed WAF due to the various use-cases in how customers configure and use their instances. Many of these controls help protect against OWASP Top Ten and other attacks. Additionally, customers have the ability to adopt third-party WAF solutions, such as Cloudflare, if the presence of a WAF is a mandatory requirement.    Additionally, The nature of ServiceNow makes it resistant to SQLi as no direct SQL access is allowed to the database and all SQL statements are mediated by the application. ServiceNow also undergoes hundred of penetration tests per year testing for vulnerabilities such as SQL injection as we allow all customers to perform a free penetration test against their sub-production instances annually as well as hire third-party penetration testing companies to perform a penetration test ahead of every major family release.

The attached \"interaction_json_blob.xlsx\" has entries from 2021 to 2023 with no IP address detail . While mostly for guest users which mean unauthenticated. The other user is \"service.pare.consumer\". From the timeline \"04-18-2023 to 07-18-2023\" (pacific timestamp) we have pulled the security logs for successful authentication to the instance \"sbb\" from the \"service.pare.consumer\". Attached is the list in case you want to give that to customer review if they do not recognize any IP and do their own internal investigation.  Further, from the description as there is no mention of IP address or a scoped time of event or other information for TIGIR to action on anything we will close this.

As per their suggestion, has Platform Technologies been engaged on this topic for any additional hardening suggestions they might have for Virtual Agent?  Ultimately any time a customer has guest user access to their platform there will be instances where guest users may attempt to test some security functions like an SQL injection type scenario. As mentioned previously ServiceNow has a number of controls in place to protect itself from these common attacks including a Secure Development Lifecycle with DAST/SAST testing, no direct SQL access to the database with it all being mediated by the platform and if customers wish to they can change viewing permissions to who has access to the virtual agent to prevent access to guest users if this is a huge concern.   After investigation by ServiceNow's security team, they have highlighted activity which we encourage the customer to investigate themselves as we cannot determine who is a legitimate user or not.

I have had three different users add child tasks in test 4 and all three of us are observing the WBS and short description fields populate for a moment, then turn to blanks after 1 to 2 seconds.  For that reason, I am rejecting the solution at this time. I was working with my developer when we were both testing in test4 and he mentioned client scripts.  Is it possible that the WBS and short description problems that we are encountering have anything to do with CS6628477 that you worked for us regarding client scripts not running in New Project Workspace.

Taria Archie Pronouns (she, her) Senior Manager, Technical Supportwork_notes: SAM NOTE - For visibility I'm sharing the customer email and reason for escalation:  Good morning Jeremy and Siva,  I need your help regarding two open Hi cases, CS6785489 and CS6785456.  Our internal customers have escalated this to my VP, Jason Keefer.  Our executive VP, Kye Prigg, is asking for a demo of ServiceNow s project management module, but we cannot demo until these items are resolved.  Can you escalate and respond back by the end of the day today with what ServiceNow can do to find the root cause and resolution for these issues?     The hi cases are related to WBS and short description fields blanking out on the New Project Workspace for Pacman. CS6785489 is for WBS and Short description fields being blank for child tasks that are manually inserted into a project.  CS6785456 is for WBS and Short description fields being blank when copying and pasting tasks in SPM/PPM.   At this point, I believe the issues may be related or the root cause is one and the same.    A solution was proposed for CS6785489 last week, but it did not resolve the problem in the sub-prod environments.  I declined the proposed solution on Friday last week.  As also asked the engineer, MeKinley Saint Victor if the issue could be related to CS6628477 that moved to PRB1671287 since there is a known issue of client scripts in the new project workspace.   Any assistance that you can provide to help us resolve this immediately would be greatly appreciated.  I can make myself and my developer available for discussion with your engineers whenever possible.

I think there's been a misunderstanding on how the Customer Information page can be accessed.  This page is not intended to be accessed directly from the /now/cwf/customercentral/customer_information   as it requires the table and sys_id parameters.  As described in the documentation, this page is accessed from the CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace:  On the Interaction, Contact, Account, or Consumer record, click the \"Customer Information\" tab to view key information on the customer (see attachment).  Use Customer Central https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/utah-customer-service-management/page/product/customer-service-management/task/use-customer-central.html  I hope this helps!

    "golden resolution notes": "   Hello Christoph,  What you are viewing is an expected behavior over the instance. The reason why it is an expected behaviour over the instance is because when you are trying to search with a keyword in different language it wouldn't be available. So, you need to create translations so that it will be showing up.  In the application navigator type in Enable i18 debugging and open any record Before the field you will see prefixes. Please see the see the below doc for your refernece wherein it needs to be created: https://docs.servicenow.com/en-US/bundle/utah-platform-administration/page/administer/localization/task/t_DisplayATranslationPrefix.html  You need to create translation on that respective tables.  So, with this update we are marking this case as Solution proposed from our end. If you feel the above information is satisfactory please do accept the solution. And once you accept the solution you would be getting an survey response for the same. Please do rate the experience you had with ServiceNow support.

Case contact will be notified of auto-close process at 2023-07-26 16:00:00 UTC.comments: Solution rejected by Christoph Langwork_notes: Auto close workflow is CANCELLED for the casecomments: Hi Sailesh,but if the translation is missing, why can it show an text at all?And if it shows an text, why can i not search for this?For me showing & searching goes hand-in-hand.I shouldn't have one without the other. For me the behavior is not consistent.Please stick to the example below.If missing texts lead to wrong behavior, how can io easily determine for which records an translation is missing?Is there a module like \"Translated Text missing\" ?Where can i find the missing translations that i need to provide in order to \"fix\" the search funtionality?The debugging option did not bring much benefit as I need to know here the translation is missing, not in which table it is stored.This I know already.comments: Hello Christoph,  To be more clear on this one if a keyword in German language is not being present when you try to search with it's English Keword it wouldn't be showing up the records. That is an expected behaviour. Now, there is no such table as the missing translation records. You need to create a translation for this one and you will be able to see the records coming up when you do the same search.  So, we request you to do the same and see how it behaves.

How can I get this list?I' am not talking about one specific record. I need a solution for literally hundreds of records.work_notes: The blocking task CS6793954 with blocking reason Need Information From Customer is closed by Christoph Langcomments: Hello Christoph,  We understand they are 100 of records being available on the instance. You need to manually create those records otherwise it would be an expected behavior over the instance. There is no way it will be creating a records manually on the instance.  Why you should be creating records is because you have installed the German language on the instance and they are sample records that would be created on teh instance for the German language. But your keywords are not being available as sample ones. So, you need to create them to see the issue being fixed.  There is another way i:e to install the dynamic translation plugin and use it as well. https://www.servicenow.com/products/dynamic-translation.html  Regards Sailesh Theegela | Senior Technical Support Engineer ServiceNow | The Enterprise Cloud Company +914066291833work_notes: The blocking task CS6793954 with blocking reason Need Information From Customer is created by Sailesh Theegela (NOW)comments: You wrote:\"...You need to manually create those records otherwise it would be an expected behavior over the instance.....\"-> \"So is it now unexpected behavior\"? You also wrote:\"The reason why it is an expected behavior over the instance is because when you are trying to search with a keyword in different language it wouldn't be available.\"-> \"So is it now expected behavior\"? Or is it the expected behavior that it will lead to unexpected behavior?Furthermore. In the official documentation:https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/utah-platform-administration/page/administer/localization/task/set-fallback-language.htmlI quote:\"... Setting a fallback language also means you don't need to add custom translations for UI strings that are suitable in the fallback language and users get UI strings in the languages most appropriate for them...\"Futhermore:\"....You cannot set English as the fallback language because it is the default fallback language.....\"But if I don't provide the necessary translations it will lead to unexpected behavior, because the search functionality is broken.So for me the text in your documentation is just wrong:\"...For example, you could set the fallback language for Mexican Spanish to Spanish. If a UI string is not translated in Mexican Spanish, it displays in Spanish instead. If a Spanish translation is not available either, the UI string displays in English. ..\"-> It will only display values, but will not allow the users to search and filter for these values. ?!?!-> Why are you proposing this to the customer's when  it will lead to wrong behavior.I ask again:How to find the records in the instance where the translation is missing so that i can add it?work_notes: The blocking task CS6793954 with blocking reason Need Information From Customer is closed by Christoph Langcomments: Hello Christoph,  Let me check and update you on this one.

Please see the below investigation  Issue:    Search Functionality is broken for non-german users.  Most Possible cause:   >> What you are viewing is an expected behavior over the instance. >> The reason why this is an expected behavior is because the field that you are trying to search is a translated text type field. >> For testing purposes I have checked for other translated text type fields that is on the announcnments table: https://zeissdev.service-now.com/sys_dictionary.do?sys_id=2c2aa55c1b103300d77ca64f2e4bcb5a&sysparm_view=&sysparm_record_target=sys_dictionary&sysparm_record_row=8&sysparm_record_list=internal_type.labelSTARTSWITHtransl%5EORDERBYname&sysparm_record_rows=883 >> If you check the screenshots being attached the first screenshot will give the results in English language >> But when you check the same in German language it wouldn't be showing up. >> Fallback language wouldn't be working on the translated text field.  >> I have tested the same in the OOTB instance and this is how it is behaving.

Fallback language cannot be working on the translated text type fields. So, there isn't any way to find out the missing translations for the records.

You can select only an active language as the fallback language. You cannot set English as the fallback language because it is the default fallback language. Select Update.

    "context": "A case was opened with a short description of Email Reader Not Working as ExpectedA longer description includes This afternoon we discovered issues with our production mailbox used for ServiceNow inbound and outbound emailing. At the time of discovery, around 4pm CST, there were over 170 unread (unprocessed) emails.Email connectivity has not been disrupted in any sense and the OAuth token is not set to expire around this time. After logging into the mailbox manually (O365), we also noticed that it was not deleting emails after they were being processed by ServiceNow. Instead, they remained 'read' and did not get deleted.We have had a similar issue before, but the cause was never identified by ServiceNow. We checked with our Office 365 administrators and they were able to confirm that the mailbox was able to receive and send mail throughout the day, has had no licensing changes, nor any other changes done to it. The issue seems to be with a component within ServiceNow.We have processed all of the unread emails, but in order to do so, we were forced to manually kick off the 'Email Reader' job, and once it was done, we then deleted the batch of emails it read/processed manually ourselves because it was not doing so automatically. We repeated this process about a dozen times or more until everything was read and processed in the mailbox.After the final batch of emails was processed manually (with the help of the reader job), the mailbox's entire inbox was cleared and as a test, we wanted to see what would happen, but the issue remains. When we visit the 'Email Diagnostics' page, it will occasionally say that email sending is non-operational, but will retain its status of 'active' and 'enabled' across the board, with one of the stats showing high processing time (upwards of 40,000ms). This issue appears to have started yesterday at some point, and even with these issues, outbound email remained functional and responsive. The primary issue as it stands now is that the mailbox has to be maintained manually, else emails are not being processed automatically.

    "context": "A case was opened with a short description of Email Reader Not Working as ExpectedA longer description includes This afternoon we discovered issues with our production mailbox used for ServiceNow inbound and outbound emailing. At the time of discovery, around 4pm CST, there were over 170 unread (unprocessed) emails.Email connectivity has not been disrupted in any sense and the OAuth token is not set to expire around this time. After logging into the mailbox manually (O365), we also noticed that it was not deleting emails after they were being processed by ServiceNow. Instead, they remained 'read' and did not get deleted.We have had a similar issue before, but the cause was never identified by ServiceNow. We checked with our Office 365 administrators and they were able to confirm that the mailbox was able to receive and send mail throughout the day, has had no licensing changes, nor any other changes done to it. The issue seems to be with a component within ServiceNow.We have processed all of the unread emails, but in order to do so, we were forced to manually kick off the 'Email Reader' job, and once it was done, we then deleted the batch of emails it read/processed manually ourselves because it was not doing so automatically. We repeated this process about a dozen times or more until everything was read and processed in the mailbox.After the final batch of emails was processed manually (with the help of the reader job), the mailbox's entire inbox was cleared and as a test, we wanted to see what would happen, but the issue remains. When we visit the 'Email Diagnostics' page, it will occasionally say that email sending is non-operational, but will retain its status of 'active' and 'enabled' across the board, with one of the stats showing high processing time (upwards of 40,000ms). This issue appears to have started yesterday at some point, and even with these issues, outbound email remained functional and responsive. The primary issue as it stands now is that the mailbox has to be maintained manually, else emails are not being processed automatically.

We've been force killing it otherwise it would sit there forever and prevent us from doing any further work. When going about it this way, it actually locks us out of using any other git operations for at least half an hour. The TSE had mentioned there's some manual work we can do alleviate this wait time.

We've been force killing it otherwise it would sit there forever and prevent us from doing any further work. When going about it this way, it actually locks us out of using any other git operations for at least half an hour. The TSE had mentioned there's some manual work we can do alleviate this wait time. We're looking to understand what that entails.

Could you please confirm if you are aware of the size of cert_audit_result table and if this is expected on mtbdev instance ?   From source control operation we do not see an issue and as per above example , operation completes successfully if it is not canceled.

Further to the update from our SME Sergiu who is working on this case with me, we have identified that source control transactions eventually are successful.  However, we can see that there are queries on the cert_audit_result that are very time-consuming and causing delays during git transactions.  Reviewing this table we can that it is very huge along with the table cert_element.  db table                        catalog   rows       data     index    free     total     reference------------------------------  --------  ---------  -------  -------  -------  --------  ---------cert_audit_result               mtbdev_1  804484689  408.3 G  591.2 G  920.0 M  1000.3 G           cert_element                    mtbdev_1  812506011  159.7 G  150.7 G    4.0 M  310.3 G           syslog0003                      mtbdev_1  196352969  138.5 G   40.9 G    6.0 M  179.4 G           syslog0002                      mtbdev_1  195440384  136.8 G   38.0 G    4.0 M  174.8 G           syslog0000                      mtbdev_1  165173117  124.0 G   33.3 G    4.0 M  157.3 G           sys_audit_delete                mtbdev_1   56664457  125.0 G   26.9 G    4.0 M  151.9 G  KB0534958  You can review these tables but I can see they are not accessible in the UI.

Thanks, Agnelowork_notes: The blocking task CS6743556 with blocking reason Need Information From Customer is closed by Agnelo Ferrao (NOW)work_notes: Auto close workflow is CANCELLED for the casecomments: Hello Agnelo,It definitely seems like these tables are causing issues given their insane size on our dev instance. Unfortunately I cannot view the KB you provided; it doesn't seem to be public/published. If you could share that with me so we can review, that would be appreciated.Even if we say querying against these two tables are the root cause, we still have three unanswered questions that we'd love an explanation for:    1. Why is the cert_audit_result table sometimes queried in the background and sometimes not? This problem with Studio taking forever to complete a routine git operation does not happen all the time, but it happens enough to be very disruptive to our overall development. Can we please get an understanding as to when this table is queried vs. when it's not?    2. Furthermore, it seems to be performing a query leveraging the 'table' column of this table. This column does not appear to even be indexed when we go to the dictionary for this table, which suggests to us there's either a very inefficient query running in the background, or we're missing an index entirely on this table?    3. Even though you say this operation eventually completes, it is still having unintended consequences. After it completes, it will mark many files, even entire tables (sys_db_object), as deleted. Refer to our most recent example of this happening: CS6787182. We really need to prevent this from happening!Hope we can get some clarity on these points.Thank you,Kylework_notes: GQM NOTE Leaving for assigned TSE to follow up with customer on follow up questionswork_notes: @Agnelo Ferrao (NOW),  Hi Agnelo, Can you provide some insight into customer's recent questions please? Thank you!!   we had following related cases escalated over the weekend: CS6788724 - tables are truncated \"cert_audit_result\" and \"cert_element\" on mtbdev CS6787182 - relief is provided, but customer is looking for root cause and prevention methods for the future  Just FYI - They currently have many other teams in the process of switching (or already switched) to the git + publishing model. They fear this issue, if not addressed quickly, may continue to crop up resulting in other apps in a broken state like in CS6787182, which causes pausing development activities for these teams. For the current team experiencing the issue today, this has happened at least 3 times with 3 different apps in the past month. The first 2 apps they were able to restore from git by applying remote changes (mentioned in here, CS6743556 ), the third was unsuccessful in that the deleted tables were \"restored\" but are now in this broken state as described in CS6787182. This application was at a standstill and was not able to move to production 7/20 as planned. Therefore, the case was escalated to try to get ahead of it before becoming a larger issue across multiple teams within M&T.

This problem with Studio taking forever to complete a routine git operation does not happen all the time, but it happens enough to be very disruptive to our overall development. Can we please get an understanding as to when this table is queried vs. when it's not? It would depend on the operation where local changes containing the table are not present in the branch being switched to, the table will be deleted and if there is data for that table in cert_audit_result, the data will be cleared during switch operation.

This column does not appear to even be indexed when we go to the dictionary for this table, which suggests to us there's either a very inefficient query running in the background, or we're missing an index entirely on this table? I checked this out of the box as well, we do not have an index on the 'table' field and I agree this will not be very efficient when the table is large.

    "context": "A case was opened with a short description of Email Reader Not Working as ExpectedA longer description includes This afternoon we discovered issues with our production mailbox used for ServiceNow inbound and outbound emailing. At the time of discovery, around 4pm CST, there were over 170 unread (unprocessed) emails.Email connectivity has not been disrupted in any sense and the OAuth token is not set to expire around this time. After logging into the mailbox manually (O365), we also noticed that it was not deleting emails after they were being processed by ServiceNow. Instead, they remained 'read' and did not get deleted.We have had a similar issue before, but the cause was never identified by ServiceNow. We checked with our Office 365 administrators and they were able to confirm that the mailbox was able to receive and send mail throughout the day, has had no licensing changes, nor any other changes done to it. The issue seems to be with a component within ServiceNow.We have processed all of the unread emails, but in order to do so, we were forced to manually kick off the 'Email Reader' job, and once it was done, we then deleted the batch of emails it read/processed manually ourselves because it was not doing so automatically. We repeated this process about a dozen times or more until everything was read and processed in the mailbox.After the final batch of emails was processed manually (with the help of the reader job), the mailbox's entire inbox was cleared and as a test, we wanted to see what would happen, but the issue remains. When we visit the 'Email Diagnostics' page, it will occasionally say that email sending is non-operational, but will retain its status of 'active' and 'enabled' across the board, with one of the stats showing high processing time (upwards of 40,000ms). This issue appears to have started yesterday at some point, and even with these issues, outbound email remained functional and responsive. The primary issue as it stands now is that the mailbox has to be maintained manually, else emails are not being processed automatically.

Issue solved some time ago, discussions with customer are on-going, do not FTS or reassign without checking SAM or EMEA Integrations Leadership  STEPS TAKEN * Jan 25 Customer Raises P2 noting Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) connectivity between DWP, and ServiceNow had failed. Their BGP network interface was showing as 'up', but could not establish a BGP peer connection. * Jan 26 CSTASK501623 CNS Backbone (aka Net Eng) BGP session drop was caused by issue on ISP network. Issue has been fixed permanently - \"Service is up and stable since 25/01/2023 21:17 GMT\" * Feb 1 CSTASK504933 Net Eng There is no cost out involved when a circuit (Colt in this case) physically is not working. There is no mechanism for customer notifications when we observe a circuit go down. These are common occurrences and are the reason for redundant physical connections. * Feb 27 Post Case Review for CS6467513  .. CS determined that DWP's connectivity was affected by their internal network configuration, meaning that the in-place redundancy options were not utilized. As the redundancy options did not auto-resolve, DWP experienced connectivity failure until the issue was resolved at 21:17 (Jan 25). Preventative Measures: ServiceNow recommends that DWP review internal network configurations to avail of all available redundancy as provided by ServiceNow. .. The ISP, COLT, experienced a hardware failure at their Newport exchange, disrupting BGP connectivity for DWP. ServiceNow provides three other BGP sessions as a redundancy measure, but DWP traffic could not avail of these, likely due to an internal network configuration. .. * March 13 Customer notes \"The preventative measure is completely unfeasible and not helpful at all - there is no detail as to what ServiceNow recommend we do.\" * May 5 Customer attaches ServiceNowLLDDiagram.pdf noting \"I've attached an overview of our network connectivity - please note that this dedicated connectivity is mirrored for each ServiceNow datacentre.\" * May 10 SAM team suggest Technical Support should keep this (Customer network Diagram) on record, under a KB, so that in the event of future network related cases, we have a basis to work on and if we need to engage with our network team, they have this diagram to work from as well. * May 11 CSTASK571012  raised for Net Eng to use ServiceNowLLDDiagram.pdf as input to add some detail to Post Case Review (aka RCA)  Preventative Measures to address Customer concerns March 13. * Meeting invite sent by Gregson  for May 15 12.00 UK - \"Discuss case CS6467513 BGP Network issues with DWP\". Invitees: Gregson Townsend, James Harland, Nadia Raychinova, David Arzola, Dielle Walker and Tony Barratt. * MAY 15: Meeting took place as scheduled. Attendees Gregson Townsend, James Harland, Nadia Raychinova,  Dielle Walker. Response on CSTASK571012 was considered: \"Regarding diagram - it does show they have redundant connections in each DC, and in case primary BGP connection (red line) goes down, traffic should be automatically rerouted to blue line. I can't say much if it's the case without seeing at least some config/routing policy on their side.  If they really experienced the issue affecting their traffic when red connection was down, it would be helpful to get analysis  from their side why traffic didn't switch to blue line (and *maybe* we can advise what can be done to fix the issue). Regarding support model - same as before, they open case with us in case BGP is down, case is assigned to Network Engineering group and engineer investigate why BGP is down and what (if anything) can be done to fix it. It didn't work well this time (network team was too late with picking up the case), but anyway we wouldn't be able to do much, just update customer, like, ok, 3rd party is down, they are working on bringing it up, but you have redundant connection, use it.\" After the meeting was concluded, SAM  team passed onto the Customer  the comments on the network diagram from CSTASK571012 and requested further information on the Customer network configuration. SAM team committed to creating a KB, intended audience Technical Support teams. KB to contain  Network Diagram to assist with any future Network related issues.  *  May 17: Customer responded to SAM Team update of May 15 voicing concerns. Example: I (Customer)  have little to no faith that if a BGP peer fails in the future, that ServiceNow will either notify us or treat our cases with the priority that they (Customer) require.  * May 22 As per meeting  - Intention is that we will meet with DWP Phil  and Dan + any interested parties on their side + Chris/Olga/Sean/Tech Support +optionally Kavitha Annamaneni (Director, Global Cloud Observability). It was noted during meeting by Chris and Sean that we could  auto-generate Customer-facing cases for ECX or CDC peering, but whether we should seemed unclear. Evidently we could  auto-generate Customer-facing cases. If so, this rasies the question what actions could/should be taken by NOW or DWP ie a runbook. * May 23: Gregson is liaising with DWP about a meetup between DWP and stakeholders (Sean and Chris for example)  on our side.  * May 31st; internal meeting with Chris/Sean/Kavitha Annamaneni (Director, Global Cloud Observability)/Support. It was decided that ** SN already monitors BGP connections and detects failures ** There are no plans to create customer facing cases for BGP connection failures ** There is no special handling notes or a similar process in Datacenter to enter any information about DWP's special configuration ** Chris provided the following text to be sent to customer if needed, they will also try to join the customer meeting as needed \"Connectivity from customers to ServiceNow via private exchange such as Equinix involves shared responsibilities.

I understand that you would like to have more information regarding the agenda for the proposed meeting. Here is what we propose:  1) Regarding monitoring and alerting for BGP routing issues, our customers have various methods for connecting to the Equinix backbone to peer with various cloud services, including ServiceNow. Such connections involve multi-supplier architectures with third party links between said cloud services and Equinix itself, and are designed to be sufficiently redundant. ServiceNow monitors continuously for outages from our end of the network, and our systems alert us internally when we see connections going down.  However, ServiceNow's policy is to not alert our customers when single connections go down; because such single-node alerting would flood our customers with frequent alerts where built-in redundancy should avoid any impact to end-users. We will invite our Network Backbone team to the meeting if you would like to discuss this further.  2) Our Network Engineering is also available if you wish to discuss your routing configuration and the diagram provided (ServiceNowLLDDiagram.pdf) in detail. We can invite our network engineers to this meeting if you would like to discuss the technical details or we can arrange a separate meeting between network teams.  3) If you prefer not to consider any changes to your network, we have already documented this issue internally and engineers who receives similar cases in the future will have instructions to prioritise the case with our Network Engineering so that we can present you with a quick analysis and the next steps to solve the issue.  Please let me know if you have any questions or when you would like to schedule a call.

Issue has been fixed permanently - \"Service is up and stable since 25/01/2023 21:17 GMT\" * Feb 1 CSTASK504933 Net Eng There is no cost out involved when a circuit (Colt in this case) physically is not working. There is no mechanism for customer notifications when we observe a circuit go down. These are common occurrences and are the reason for redundant physical connections. * Feb 27 Post Case Review for CS6467513  .. CS determined that DWP's connectivity was affected by their internal network configuration, meaning that the in-place redundancy options were not utilized. As the redundancy options did not auto-resolve, DWP experienced connectivity failure until the issue was resolved at 21:17 (Jan 25). Preventative Measures: ServiceNow recommends that DWP review internal network configurations to avail of all available redundancy as provided by ServiceNow. .. The ISP, COLT, experienced a hardware failure at their Newport exchange, disrupting BGP connectivity for DWP. ServiceNow provides three other BGP sessions as a redundancy measure, but DWP traffic could not avail of these, likely due to an internal network configuration. .. * March 13 Customer notes \"The preventative measure is completely unfeasible and not helpful at all - there is no detail as to what ServiceNow recommend we do.\" * May 5 Customer attaches ServiceNowLLDDiagram.pdf noting \"I've attached an overview of our network connectivity - please note that this dedicated connectivity is mirrored for each ServiceNow datacentre.\" * May 10 SAM team suggest Technical Support should keep this (Customer network Diagram) on record, under a KB, so that in the event of future network related cases, we have a basis to work on and if we need to engage with our network team, they have this diagram to work from as well. * May 11 CSTASK571012  raised for Net Eng to use ServiceNowLLDDiagram.pdf as input to add some detail to Post Case Review (aka RCA)  Preventative Measures to address Customer concerns March 13. * Meeting invite sent by Gregson  for May 15 12.00 UK - \"Discuss case CS6467513 BGP Network issues with DWP\". Invitees: Gregson Townsend, James Harland, Nadia Raychinova, David Arzola, Dielle Walker and Tony Barratt. * MAY 15: Meeting took place as scheduled. Attendees Gregson Townsend, James Harland, Nadia Raychinova,  Dielle Walker. Response on CSTASK571012 was considered: \"Regarding diagram - it does show they have redundant connections in each DC, and in case primary BGP connection (red line) goes down, traffic should be automatically rerouted to blue line. I can't say much if it's the case without seeing at least some config/routing policy on their side.  If they really experienced the issue affecting their traffic when red connection was down, it would be helpful to get analysis  from their side why traffic didn't switch to blue line (and *maybe* we can advise what can be done to fix the issue). Regarding support model - same as before, they open case with us in case BGP is down, case is assigned to Network Engineering group and engineer investigate why BGP is down and what (if anything) can be done to fix it. It didn't work well this time (network team was too late with picking up the case), but anyway we wouldn't be able to do much, just update customer, like, ok, 3rd party is down, they are working on bringing it up, but you have redundant connection, use it.\" After the meeting was concluded, SAM  team passed onto the Customer  the comments on the network diagram from CSTASK571012 and requested further information on the Customer network configuration. SAM team committed to creating a KB, intended audience Technical Support teams. KB to contain  Network Diagram to assist with any future Network related issues.  *  May 17: Customer responded to SAM Team update of May 15 voicing concerns. Example: I (Customer)  have little to no faith that if a BGP peer fails in the future, that ServiceNow will either notify us or treat our cases with the priority that they (Customer) require.  * May 22 As per meeting  - Intention is that we will meet with DWP Phil  and Dan + any interested parties on their side + Chris/Olga/Sean/Tech Support +optionally Kavitha Annamaneni (Director, Global Cloud Observability). It was noted during meeting by Chris and Sean that we could  auto-generate Customer-facing cases for ECX or CDC peering, but whether we should seemed unclear. Evidently we could  auto-generate Customer-facing cases. If so, this rasies the question what actions could/should be taken by NOW or DWP ie a runbook. * May 23: Gregson is liaising with DWP about a meetup between DWP and stakeholders (Sean and Chris for example)  on our side.  * May 31st; internal meeting with Chris/Sean/Kavitha Annamaneni (Director, Global Cloud Observability)/Support. It was decided that ** SN already monitors BGP connections and detects failures ** There are no plans to create customer facing cases for BGP connection failures ** There is no special handling notes or a similar process in Datacenter to enter any information about DWP's special configuration ** Chris provided the following text to be sent to customer if needed, they will also try to join the customer meeting as needed \"Connectivity from customers to ServiceNow via private exchange such as Equinix involves shared responsibilities. This includes 3rd parties that provide connectivity to Equinix itself. Customers have various methods of connecting to the Equinix backbone in order to peer with ServiceNow and other cloud services. As such ServiceNow cannot maintain sole responsibility for ECX peering's. ServiceNow continues to recommend that for ECX peering issues customers create cases with Equinix, ServiceNow, and any third parties customers might use for connection to Equinix.\" * Updated the SHN for DWP in HI and added information on how to handle future BGP issues.

I understand that you would like to have more information regarding the agenda for the proposed meeting. Here is what we propose:  1) Regarding monitoring and alerting for BGP routing issues, our customers have various methods for connecting to the Equinix backbone to peer with various cloud services, including ServiceNow. Such connections involve multi-supplier architectures with third party links between said cloud services and Equinix itself, and are designed to be sufficiently redundant. ServiceNow monitors continuously for outages from our end of the network, and our systems alert us internally when we see connections going down.  However, ServiceNow's policy is to not alert our customers when single connections go down; because such single-node alerting would flood our customers with frequent alerts where built-in redundancy should avoid any impact to end-users. We will invite our Network Backbone team to the meeting if you would like to discuss this further.  2) Our Network Engineering is also available if you wish to discuss your routing configuration and the diagram provided (ServiceNowLLDDiagram.pdf) in detail. We can invite our network engineers to this meeting if you would like to discuss the technical details or we can arrange a separate meeting between network teams.  3) If you prefer not to consider any changes to your network, we have already documented this issue internally and engineers who receives similar cases in the future will have instructions to prioritise the case with our Network Engineering so that we can present you with a quick analysis and the next steps to solve the issue.  Please let me know if you have any questions or when you would like to schedule a call.

Dan said that he knows that their Network team will not accept the invite and that there may not be any profit to any such discussions. Dan said that the Special Handling Notes we have in place should suffice and he said that DWP staff can guide NOW teams to review the SHN, if it is not being followed, in the event of a network/BGP issue.

See screenshot (CS6777765.png) Next Steps: Please review the above info and let me know     As part of the troubleshooting process, I and other ServiceNow personnel may need to access your instance(s) in order to review the service impact to your instance and determine the root cause.

Additionally, I have included response templates in the Human Resources: Workspace for the sc_task, incident, and sn_hr_core_task tables. However, I kindly request the addition of the \"Copy to Clipboard\" action.I have already transferred these modifications to the UAT (User Acceptance Testing) environment. Please also add the copy to clipboard  for both Workspaces.Given that we don't have the necessary access to create the \"Copy to Clipboard\" action, Would you require us to move the changes to the Production environment first. Once the changes are successfully implemented in Production, we can then inform you to update the environment with the missing \"Copy to Clipboard\" action? Kindly advise.Regards,Monicau_hop_notes: HOP rights have been granted to user: Amanda Sazon (NOW)u_hop_notes: HOP rights have been granted to user: Massimo Rivetti (NOW)comments: Hi Monica,  Good to know that both incident and sc_task are now working on the dev instance.

I would like to confirm the following is correct for the issue you are currently facing:     Issue:     Not all records are displayed for CSM Case records that are created from agent workspace or backend    Steps to Reproduce:     1. Log in prounlimitedqa as yourself 2. Create couple CSM Cases (cases --> Create New menu). Make sure opened by is set as one of the following user, Heather Moeslein \" user account (heathermoeslein@gmail.com) OR dsavic217@gmail.com Select account as \"Genentech\", assignment group as \"Contingent Payroll Case Management Team\" 3. Impersonate \"dsavic217@gmail.com\" and navigate to the /help portal 4. Select \"My Cases\" menu on top 5. Select \"My cases\" on left side (In \"My Lists section, see attached image) 6. Case created in step 2 is not displayed even though filter says current user is in watchlist or opened by (you can also remove the filter and it sill display the same) ----------------- 7. Go to \"Open a case\" and submit a record (you can fill the information as shown in the screenshot): https://prounlimitedqa.service-now.com/help?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=c9fc5cad1b43a55097e85395604bcbac&referrer=popular_items 8. Submit the record 8. Select \"My Cases\" menu on top 9. Select \"My cases\" on left side 10. Case created in step 7-8 is displayed   Cause:  When impersonating dsavic217@gmail.com and accessing the below record, there was an error that is throwing \"No record Found\" https://prounlimitedqa.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=sn_customerservice_case.do?sys_id=63febf4ac328b11012ac7df4e4013151%26sysparm_view=case Later when I verified all the query BRs, I found that below is the suspect \"Case query rules\" https://prounlimitedqa.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=sys_script.do?sys_id=ee1a06e00f7a10103ff81b41ff767e75 When I deactivated the specified BR, the user is able to access the table, but not the fields. The user doesn't have Field level read access to the table. For testing purposes, i have given \"sn_customerservice.customer_admin\" he is able to access the record.  Solution Proposed: So to fix this issue, the user should have field-level read access to the specified records   Next Steps:    I am moving this case into Solution Proposed State.  Please let me know if you have any questions without rejecting the solution. If you have no further questions then please login to HI and accept the solution to close the Case or let me know by e-mail and I will close it for you.

Case contact will be notified of auto-close process at 2023-08-15 16:00:00 UTC.work_notes: Auto close workflow is CANCELLED for the casecomments: Hi Siva,Thank you for reply. I am rejecting the solution due to couple of reasons.1. \"Case query rules\" is Out of the box business rules and we didn't modify it. I am wondering why we should deactivate it then? From my understanding this rule works if the user doesn't meet any of the previous query rules on sn_customerservice_case table.2. The user dsavic217@gmail.com can see case records and all needed fields if he submits records via \"record producer\" (as mentioned in the earlier steps). This was confirmed by the support tech \"Rachana Patel\". If user does not have field level access, then how can he see the cases and its respective fields for cases created via record producer?3. Giving customer_admin role and trying is not a feasible solution. When user get a customer_admin role, he will get admin level access on case table and no field level acl is required.My question is why it's working when the case record is created from record producer and not working while the record is created via backend or csm workspace? Please advise.I am ready for a call if you want to take a look at the issue together.Thanks,Tomscomments: Solution rejected by Toms Varkeycomments: Hi Siva,Thank you for reply.

My name is Jackie, and I will assist you with your case. I would like to confirm the following is correct:   Assistance Requested:  You would like to check why the temp instance provided to restore the DEV instance does not restore the certificate.  Business Impact:  __FOR_P2_REQUEST_IT_IF_NOT_PROVIDED_BY_CUSTOMER__   The instance copy may have taken a backup with no data in the sys_certificate table.  Steps to Reproduce:    Thank you for bringing this to our attention. After checking, the instance copy may have taken a backup with no data in the sys_certificate table. Please could you confirm on when the time the table was populated? We could then proceed with another Instance Copy to check the content of that table (ideally from the latest backup) if the table is populated now.  Look forward to hearing from you shortly.  As part of the troubleshooting process, I and other ServiceNow personnel may need to access your instance(s) in order to review the service impact to your instance and determine the root cause.

Exclude large attachment data  Prevents the cloning of large attachments such as video files, image files, and other large binary file types. Use this option to exclude all common binary file types, regardless of file size. When selected, the clone also excludes attachments from the Attachments [sys_attachment] and Attachment Documents [sys_attachment_doc] tables that meet all these criteria.  The attachment table_name value does not indicate that it is a small file. Small attachments have table-name values that start with ZZ_. The attachment data type value indicates that it is a large file such as an application or video. The attachment table_name is not one of these system tables: sys_certificate, ecc_agent_jar, ecc_agent_mib, sys_store_app, or invisible.sys_store_app. This option is selected by default.  https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB1214608   should you need further assistance reopen and unassign - as we monitor the unassigned queue...work_notes: CSTASK607832 (Instance Automation) Task notes  updated by muneer.moinuddinPlease disregard previous update, as it is Instance copy where the KB was provided for Clonework_notes: CSTASK607832 (Instance Automation) Task notes  updated by muneer.moinuddinRestoring backup(s):  +--------+-----------------------------------------------------+--------+---------------------+---------------------+----------+-----------------------+---------------------+--------+-------+  | server | backup_id                                           | age    | start_date          | end_date            | size     | backup_retention_days | destroy_date        | bucket | type  |  +--------+-----------------------------------------------------+--------+---------------------+---------------------+----------+-----------------------+---------------------+--------+-------+  |        | sncfreseaudev_3415_db174148_26-4_2023-06-24_0307377 | 2 days | 2023-06-24 03:08:46 | 2023-06-24 03:20:19 | 29.13G   | 30                    | 2023-07-24 03:08:46 |        | mysql |  +--------+-----------------------------------------------------+--------+---------------------+---------------------+----------+-----------------------+---------------------+--------+-------+  |        | sncfreseaudev_3415_db174148_26_2023-06-20_1705206   | 5 days | 2023-06-20 17:06:31 | 2023-06-20 18:14:34 | 1.44T    | 30                    | 2023-07-20 17:06:31 |        | mysql |  +--------+-----------------------------------------------------+--------+---------------------+---------------------+----------+-----------------------+---------------------+--------+-------+  |        |                                                     |        |                     |                     | T: 1.46T |                       |                     | N: 2   |       |  +--------+-----------------------------------------------------+--------+---------------------+---------------------+----------+-----------------------+---------------------+--------+-------+work_notes: CSTASK607832 (Instance Automation) Task notes  updated by muneer.moinuddinInstance copy perform X over Y , so data should be available in sncfreseaudevtesttemp1 in sys_certificate table.work_notes: CSTASK607832 (Instance Automation) Task notes  updated by muneer.moinuddinCan you please try this with latest backup and see ?comments: Hello @Daniel Ehrmann,     Thank you for your patience.  My name is Jackie, and I will assist you with your case. I would like to confirm the following is correct:   Assistance Requested:  You would like to check why the temp instance provided to restore the DEV instance does not restore the certificate.  Business Impact:  __FOR_P2_REQUEST_IT_IF_NOT_PROVIDED_BY_CUSTOMER__   The instance copy may have taken a backup with no data in the sys_certificate table.  Steps to Reproduce:    Thank you for bringing this to our attention. After checking, the instance copy may have taken a backup with no data in the sys_certificate table. Please could you confirm on when the time the table was populated? We could then proceed with another Instance Copy to check the content of that table (ideally from the latest backup) if the table is populated now.  Look forward to hearing from you shortly.  As part of the troubleshooting process, I and other ServiceNow personnel may need to access your instance(s) in order to review the service impact to your instance and determine the root cause. It may also be necessary to make some changes on a sub-production instance in order to troubleshoot the issue or to test a probable solution.

Best Regards, Jackie Cheung ServiceNow Customer Supportwork_notes: CSTASK619828 (DevOps-Snc-OnNow) Task notes  updated by rajasekharr.genupulaHello Team,  Summary in single line: I guess we have to extend the instance copy automation to handle the cases where customer would like to preserve some of X data as is, for example sys_certificates.   Explanation: In this case, let me explain with example - source_instance001 requested with Instance copy automation. - Instance copy provisioned an instance named source_instance001_testtemp before calling X over Y {{ X over Y Context }} - before restore, we took backup of Y data ( source_instance001_testtemp) which also includes : sys_certificates table - Important point: Y is a fresh instance, just now provisioned, so it will not have any certificates which are custom except the one's will be added as part of instance provisioning, which are 2 in this case.  - source instance backup has been restored into source_instance001_testtemp - Before next point: Now the Y instance new target DBI have all 52 certs from X instance backup , this is what customer expected, and this is not behaviour of X over Y automation.   - post restore, we have restored back that backup of Y data we took before the restore as part of preservers and exclusions concept.  - Now all those 52 certs are gone and what ever the backup of sys_certificate we took earlier to restore, automation uploaded that into the Y instance , those 2 certs from fresh Y instance.   Due to this we are not able to see all those certs from X instance in new Y instance even though it is instance copy.   Possible Next Steps ( My view): => In instance copy automation, at very ending of restore context, we can get the delta from X  instance for required rows/table and restore it back into Y new target DBI.   Please let me know if more information required.  Thank you.

Based on my conversation with Priyanka, my understanding is that this project is still not live and expected to Go-Live on 31 Oct 2023. Hence the report show very low(less than 1%) license consumption. We can get better picture of usage only when customer starts consuming the licenses.   You have requested the data on monthly basis, that will require you to share the data files as per the knowledge article with TechM's Global Partner Sales contact (As of now, that's Michelle).

In Usage Summary Tab in Contract Quantity Column we see there are figures related to different Products.Does those figures count for the number of licenses for those Products. In our case Telecommunications Services Management Professional with App Engine 100 has 1900 licenses purchased out of which 12 are being consumed.If this is correct, then the total number of Licenses available is 7504?3. Are the number of Licenses currently in use 12 from Telecommunications Services Management Professional with App Engine 100 product and apart from this no other license is being currently used?Similarly, We have few more questions related to this report which we shall discuss them in the meeting once scheduled.Hope this information helps.The reason why we are stressing out so much on this  report is these numbers will be showcased to client on a monthly basis and need to have a clear information on each and every tab of the report.Best Regards,Kaneez E Farwawork_notes: The blocking task CSTASK630996 with blocking reason Need Task Completion is created by Laurence Colleton (NOW)work_notes: CSTASK630996 (Licensing & Use Verification) has been createdcomments: Hello Kaneez,  My name is Laurence, and I am providing coverage for Johnson.

This is ServiceNow internal email. I think we will need to involve one more stakeholder internally, Asheet Sinvhal - Senior Subscription and Compliance Analyst. I am Looping him in too   @Asheet Sinvhal, Thanks for creating and sharing the report. As the next steps, customer is asking help to understand and read the report. Can there be a meeting setup with you to help answer customer's queries listed below? Kindly advice   1. What does Purchased Allocation in the Contract mean? Does it mean the Licenses Purchased by customer so far.... [AS: Yes]   2. In Usage Summary Tab in Contract Quantity Column we see there are figures related to different Products. Does those figures count for the number of licenses for those Products. In our case Telecommunications Services Management Professional with App Engine 100 has 1900 licenses purchased out of which 12 are being consumed. If this is correct, then the total number of Licenses available is 7504?   [AS: No. Total licenses are not 7504. As sharing of licenses across multiple products is not allowed. Every product will have its own license usage limit. For Telecom Service Management the license usage limit is 1900 and if 12 users are allotted its license, then only 1888 (Fulfiller) licenses are available for use. ]   3. Are the number of Licenses currently in use 12 from Telecommunications Services Management Professional with App Engine 100 product and apart from this no other license is being currently used? [AS: Yes. This is obtained from the data files provided to us.]       _________________________________ Akansha Verma (She/her/hers) Partner Technology Strategist M: +918939478780 LinkedIn | Twitter | YouTube | Facebook   The Now Platform  Utah release is here     From: Sharad Kulkarni  Date: Tuesday, 8 August 2023 at 12:11 PM To: Shams Qureshi , Sarah Spencer , Gena Calvin , Laurence Colleton , Mitesh Shah , Bemanapally Sandeep Kumar , Akansha Verma , Johnson Wieczorek , Mats Carlsson  Cc: Sriharsha Ramchandra , Himanshu Deshmukh  Subject: Tech Mahindra Tele2 Sverige AB License usage report : CS6710416: Tech Mahindra (MSP-EA) - Tele2 Sverige AB + Looping in Akansha verma, Mats Carlsson,      Hi @Laurence,   Thank you for your email!!

Currently holding ~100 per 5 minutes. *502 for the week leading up to the first spike last Friday.   We have flagged this Case with \"Temporary Relief\" because the issue is not impacting your instance at this time.  Steps to Relief:   1.Regarding failover from A to B nodes and at the moment back again to A node, no impact is observed however it will reduce the HTTP request count which you will able to see when we start our next bridge call.  2.We will continue monitoring  this issue and at the moment we observed that the connections for bwi100 VIP (subprods) dropped from 40k to around 50 after failing over to B, restarting process and failing back. We observed that the worker process wasn't behaving correctly and was either holding either available or borrowed connections, or reporting connections that weren't there.  3.We would also like to set the expectation early that for the bwi100 container issue (40k phantom connections) we probably won't get to the bottom of the issue from this occurrence. If a worker process crashed then we may need a core dump and analysis by the vendor to get to the bottom of that. Because we've restarted the process that core dump information is no longer available. If it were to happen again then we should get the vendor involved to assist in debug.  4.Connections for the phx100 VIP (prod) dropped from ~15k to ~3.5k. These were mirrored in netstat sockets which we are currently checking and we will keep you informed with our findings.  5.We will continue to troubleshoot the issue and check the Traffic pattern and if we observe anything at our end we will let you know  6.Troubleshooting ongoing to understand why  stalenetwork  connections are still being persistent between netskope and ServiceNow  7. IPS setting on Netskope tenant has been disabled. 502 errors dropped after disabling the setting.  8. ServiceNow domains (discover.service-now.com & discoversandbox.service-now.com) have been added in steering exceptions to bypass Netskope as a temporary workaround and go via Bluecoat proxy   Next Steps: We are continuing to investigate the root cause so we can propose a solution to fix/resolve this issue.

Impact Start Time:  6:27 PM UTC, 2023-06-16Est. Impact End Time:  12:27 AM UTC, 2023-06-17Relief: Service has been restored as you have confirmed.Summary: You previously reported sporadic performance degradation, including intermittent &#39;404&#39; and &#39;502&#39; error messages on the &#39;discover&#39; production instance. This is impacting users ability to do their normal work activities without having to perform frequent browser page refreshes.Actions taken: ServiceNow has reconvened on the 10:00 ET June 23rd scheduled MS Teams bridge call with your team and Netskope vendor for troubleshooting the network connection issues seen between Netskope and ServiceNow from the packet captures that were provided. You have agreed on the call, that since your team implemented a bypass of the Netskope proxy on the &#39;discover&#39; production instance to your bluecoat proxy as a workaround as of 19:27 US/Central on July 22, the issue is no longer being observed during your current peak business hours today, June 23, and temporary relief can be declared while root cause investigations continue. Previously, the IPS setting was briefly re-enabled before the workaround was implemented in order to allow Netskope to perform packet captures with the network traffic having the &#39;502&#39; error. In parallel ServiceNow performed packet captures which were provided to Netskope for their analysis. We observed that when the Netskope client was disabled on a computer, users no longer experienced the &#39;502&#39; error messages. Your team had advised us that a Netskope Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) setting was enabled about an hour before you noticed HTTP traffic began to increase and you started to experience the &#39;502&#39; errors this past Friday, June 16th.Most Probable Cause: The most probable cause is suspected to be due to network connection errors between Netskope and ServiceNow since the Netskope Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) setting was enabled on Friday, June 16th with a large increase in the volume of active network connection sessions. However, we are continuing to investigate.  Next steps: This case has been moved to a state of Temporary Relief as the issue is no longer impacting users during peak hours since your team implemented the workaround to bypass the Netskope proxy.  ServiceNow is continuing to troubleshoot with your team and Netskope the network connections packet captures to establish the root cause and propose a permanent solution to fix/resolve this issue. This represents the final case action summary relating to this event.

We observed that the worker process wasn't behaving correctly and was either holding either available or borrowed connections, or reporting connections that weren't there.  3.We would also like to set the expectation early that for the bwi100 container issue (40k phantom connections) we probably won't get to the bottom of the issue from this occurrence. If a worker process crashed then we may need a core dump and analysis by the vendor to get to the bottom of that. Because we've restarted the process that core dump information is no longer available. If it were to happen again then we should get the vendor involved to assist in debug.  4.Connections for the phx100 VIP (prod) dropped from ~15k to ~3.5k.

Impact Start Time:  6:27 PM UTC, 2023-06-16Est. Impact End Time:  12:27 AM UTC, 2023-06-17Relief: Service has been restored as you have confirmed.Summary: You previously reported sporadic performance degradation, including intermittent &#39;404&#39; and &#39;502&#39; error messages on the &#39;discover&#39; production instance. This is impacting users ability to do their normal work activities without having to perform frequent browser page refreshes.Actions taken: ServiceNow has reconvened on the 10:00 ET June 23rd scheduled MS Teams bridge call with your team and Netskope vendor for troubleshooting the network connection issues seen between Netskope and ServiceNow from the packet captures that were provided. You have agreed on the call, that since your team implemented a bypass of the Netskope proxy on the &#39;discover&#39; production instance to your bluecoat proxy as a workaround as of 19:27 US/Central on July 22, the issue is no longer being observed during your current peak business hours today, June 23, and temporary relief can be declared while root cause investigations continue. Previously, the IPS setting was briefly re-enabled before the workaround was implemented in order to allow Netskope to perform packet captures with the network traffic having the &#39;502&#39; error. In parallel ServiceNow performed packet captures which were provided to Netskope for their analysis. We observed that when the Netskope client was disabled on a computer, users no longer experienced the &#39;502&#39; error messages. Your team had advised us that a Netskope Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) setting was enabled about an hour before you noticed HTTP traffic began to increase and you started to experience the &#39;502&#39; errors this past Friday, June 16th.Most Probable Cause: The most probable cause is suspected to be due to network connection errors between Netskope and ServiceNow since the Netskope Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) setting was enabled on Friday, June 16th with a large increase in the volume of active network connection sessions. However, we are continuing to investigate.  Next steps: This case has been moved to a state of Temporary Relief as the issue is no longer impacting users during peak hours since your team implemented the workaround to bypass the Netskope proxy.  ServiceNow is continuing to troubleshoot with your team and Netskope the network connections packet captures to establish the root cause and propose a permanent solution to fix/resolve this issue.

Regards, Patrick Perloni ServiceNow Senior TSE, Performance Direct: 407-499-2695 US: 866-709-5932comments: Temporary Relief provided by Patrick Perloni (NOW)comments: Hello James,  After reviewing the instance, it does still appear that the full system cache flush was the largest contributor the performance experienced when the case was opened. We recommend against actions that would trigger this as there is a high performance cost for 1-10 minutes as all of the nodes flush and rebuild the cache. Here is a high level summary:  - The full system cache flush was initiated.  - Nodes performed this while still processing transactions. - The impact was enough to slow down transaction to the point where it resulted in the default semaphore pool reaching maximum depth. - When the pool is at max depth, it starts to reject transactions destined for that pool (error 429).  While the JVM itself was not down, these transaction rejections would be what our monitoring and your users would experience as the instance being unavailable.

Good afternoon team-  I have been working with the TSE that owns CS6794824. We were investigating the cache flush that was the root cause on 7/24. I asked them to look into the same type of cache flush to see the time of day they have been running prior to and since. I ve attached the 2 files (June 22nd -June 30th & July). The dates and times show they have all been performed after hours or on the weekend except for the one on 7/24, at 12:20pm. (It only produced date back until June 22nd in the report)  Would you please take a look at these and let me know your thoughts regarding the current case open? It does appear this is not a normal task that happens during business hours and should take place after or on weekends.  Thank you!work_notes: SAM notes- James' response: We do not perform cache flushes on any regular basis. The issue is that if there is an emergency and we need to flush the cache or change a system property our instance will crash the same way it did last week. That is not acceptable. ICE is 27x7, so there is always some activity on the system and there is no strict definition of \"business hours\". We do have change windows and can accommodate scheduled downtime, but this is just random downtime if you change a system setting. My ask was to determine what the load was on the system before it became unavailable so we can look for any indicators that might cause a problem if we have to change a system setting during the day.  I followed up with: Ok, thank you for the input. I did originally state that ask to the TSE and will follow up with the same. He will likely put the details in the case notes once completed.  Sidenote as well: Because you are now part of the Impact program, we have an application accessible by certain pre-named users, called Instance Observer. This tool is VERY helpful in taking a random look at the health and stability of your instance. I will talk to the Squad, and we can find some time on the calendar for your team to gain this access and start using it asap. I think you all will use this on a regular basis to check performance as well as semaphore use. I ll get back to you soon!  Instance Observer might be the best option here. However, they haven't been introduced to this yet and I will work with the Impact Squad on getting that set up. In the meantime, is there something you can share with James to assist with his ask?comments: ",

After logging into the mailbox manually (O365), we also noticed that it was not deleting emails after they were being processed by ServiceNow. Instead, they remained 'read' and did not get deleted.We have had a similar issue before, but the cause was never identified by ServiceNow. We checked with our Office 365 administrators and they were able to confirm that the mailbox was able to receive and send mail throughout the day, has had no licensing changes, nor any other changes done to it. The issue seems to be with a component within ServiceNow.We have processed all of the unread emails, but in order to do so, we were forced to manually kick off the 'Email Reader' job, and once it was done, we then deleted the batch of emails it read/processed manually ourselves because it was not doing so automatically. We repeated this process about a dozen times or more until everything was read and processed in the mailbox.After the final batch of emails was processed manually (with the help of the reader job), the mailbox's entire inbox was cleared and as a test, we wanted to see what would happen, but the issue remains.

    "prompt": "<|system|>\nA case was opened with a short description of Email Reader Not Working as ExpectedA longer description includes This afternoon we discovered issues with our production mailbox used for ServiceNow inbound and outbound emailing. At the time of discovery, around 4pm CST, there were over 170 unread (unprocessed) emails.Email connectivity has not been disrupted in any sense and the OAuth token is not set to expire around this time. After logging into the mailbox manually (O365), we also noticed that it was not deleting emails after they were being processed by ServiceNow. Instead, they remained 'read' and did not get deleted.We have had a similar issue before, but the cause was never identified by ServiceNow. We checked with our Office 365 administrators and they were able to confirm that the mailbox was able to receive and send mail throughout the day, has had no licensing changes, nor any other changes done to it. The issue seems to be with a component within ServiceNow.We have processed all of the unread emails, but in order to do so, we were forced to manually kick off the 'Email Reader' job, and once it was done, we then deleted the batch of emails it read/processed manually ourselves because it was not doing so automatically. We repeated this process about a dozen times or more until everything was read and processed in the mailbox.After the final batch of emails was processed manually (with the help of the reader job), the mailbox's entire inbox was cleared and as a test, we wanted to see what would happen, but the issue remains. When we visit the 'Email Diagnostics' page, it will occasionally say that email sending is non-operational, but will retain its status of 'active' and 'enabled' across the board, with one of the stats showing high processing time (upwards of 40,000ms). This issue appears to have started yesterday at some point, and even with these issues, outbound email remained functional and responsive. The primary issue as it stands now is that the mailbox has to be maintained manually, else emails are not being processed automatically.

Export from the keystore the new certificate used by the secure WS, in PEM format . You will need to know the certificate alias for this operation or If you have a cer X509 certificate, you could convert it as follow: > openssl x509 -inform der -in certificate.cer -out certificate.pem >OpenSSL Convert P7B:  openssl pkcs7 -print_certs -in certificate.p7b -out certificate.cer  2.Import into ServiceNow the new provided keystore.

Import into ServiecNow the new x509 certificate in PEM format.  4.Modify the WS security X509 Outbound profile for this WS call to correctly point to: a) the new keystore record, b) the new certificate record , and c) the certificate alias.

Also are you using a Mid server for the working SOAP or not?  Also which Mid server are you intending to use this on in UAT?

Export from the keystore the new certificate used by the secure WS, in PEM format . You will need to know the certificate alias for this operation or If you have a cer X509 certificate, you could convert it as follow: > openssl x509 -inform der -in certificate.cer -out certificate.pem >OpenSSL Convert P7B: openssl pkcs7 -print_certs -in certificate.p7b -out certificate.cer  2.Import into ServiceNow the new provided keystore. We recommend in PKCS12 format.  3. Import into ServiecNow the new x509 certificate in PEM format.  4.Modify the WS security X509 Outbound profile for this WS call to correctly point to: a) the new keystore record, b) the new certificate record , and c) the certificate alias.  Please get back to me once you have updated the PEM certificate for a valid one and provide the results.

The only instances that it lists as included are:  tek, tektest, tekdev, tekmgdsvcstest. There is nothing in this order to connect the subscription to the instance referenced in this CHG, therefore, something needs to be changed in the contract, which I am not able to do. Your ServiceNow Account Manager, Matthew, should work with SalesOps and Orders to get this straightened out. Unfortunately, I do not have visibility to any other order that would be connected to the tgs instance. If this order was not applied to the correct instances, then it needs to be addressed through Matthew and the SalesOps or Orders teams.  Sincerely, Brenda Henrywork_notes: Change CHG46729982 has additional comments - reply from: jeremijohnson@teksystems.comMatthew,Once again this is the response we got. Who can we escalate this to. We are getting nowhere with support.Appreciate all your help but I can t help but ask why this is an ongoing issue with something we signed an order for. I would expect we shouldn t be encountering these type of delays. Can we escalate this and get this completed today. We have been going back and forth on this and after them confirming they would make the changes they came back and said they won t.Please unblock this and get this moving forward.Best Regards,Jeremiah Johnsonwork_notes: Change CHG46729982 has additional comments - Hello Jeremiah,  If you are only going to be using Agile Team in the tgs instances and not using it in the tek instances, the Order processing team should have listed tgs related instances as the applied instances. If Agile Team is going to be used in both sets of instances, that would require the subscription to be applied to both sets of instances. I am not sure if you are referencing 'me' when you indicate: 'after them confirming they would make the changes they came back and said they won't' this is not an accurate statement. If it is another side of support telling you this, then you should use communicate through CS6700461.  Sincerely, Brenda Henrywork_notes: Change CHG46729982 has additional comments - reply from: jeremijohnson@teksystems.comBrenda,As confirmed in the attached case it was stated to us they would correct this as this is as mentioned a brand new order not whatever that was for ORD1897938-1, that was added to the contract on 2023-05-18.That was supposed to go to our new domain separated instance https://tgs.service-now.com. This was signed and was for our new environment. The TEK instance you mentioned is not part of our project nor part of the instance that order was for.Matthew: Please correct this asap.work_notes: Change CHG46729982 has additional comments - Hello Jeremiah,  I think that the processing team for ORD1897938-1 may have mistakenly indicated the wrong instances. ORD1897938-1 also indicates Domain Separation along with the Agile Team subscription. I can also confirm that you are not using Agile Team in the tek instance, so this should not be a problem. I will reach out to SalesOps to see if we can expedite the correction. I will also see if SalesOps can provide approval for the activation of the plugin in the tgs instance while they work on correcting the instances.  Our apologies for this and I hope to get it straightened out ASAP.  Sincerely, Brenda Henrycomments: Dear customer,  This is a follow up to a request for additional information.

Best regards,  ServiceNowcomments: reply from: jeremijohnson@teksystems.comMorning,From the change request they committed the Agile Development was installed however this is still blocked until we have 100% had our license applied to the correct production instance. They were working on correcting the mistake where they applied our new order to TEK instead of TGS production instance. Once I get confirmation from your team that the license has been moved and fixed I will consider this closed but until this this has to remain open as this has not been corrected.We still need to have Test Management 2.0 which is included in the Agile team license applied to our production. They went ahead and installed just the Agile Management 2.0 plugin but didn t include the Test Management 2.0 plugin.Can you ensure that the license is applied to this instance as it was supposed to be when we submitted the order. You can refer to the notes within the change ticket CHG46729982Please do not close this until the work is complete moving the license to the correct environment.Thank youwork_notes: The blocking task CS6700461 with blocking reason Need Information From Customer is closed by Jeremiah Johnsonu_hop_notes: HOP rights have been granted to user: Rodrigo Prata (NOW)u_hop_notes: HOP rights have been granted to user: Chrystal Santos (NOW)u_hop_notes: HOP rights have been granted to user: Matthew Lisenby (NOW)u_hop_notes: HOP rights have been granted to user: Laurence Colleton (NOW)comments: Hello Jeremiah,  Thank you for your response  Thank you for reaching out to our NowSupport!

We are moving your case to Solution Proposed as we believe the information provided below will resolve your issue. If we have addressed your concerns, you may accept the solution to close this case or reject the solution if it does not answer the original question raised with this ticket. At any time in the Solution Proposed state, you may add additional questions or updates.    Issue:  Need to understand how the expected wait time works  for Queues  Steps to Reproduce:  Question related to Wait Time Calculation on Agent Chat Queues  Solution Proposed:  The calculation itself is started by the OOB business rule \"Calculate Avg Wait Time for Queue\" from the \"interaction\" table (sys_id = 67fb72d237330300a213a7f07e41f1a9) Within this business rule it's using the function \"refreshAvgWaitTime()\" which is actually a function from a back-end Java file.   This Java function computes the average wait time as following: 1) Get the latest 20 \"interaction\" (the table that keeps track of the walk-up requests) records where state = Work in Progress for a particular queue location 2) Get their \"wait_time\" values 3) Add all of these up and divide it by 20 (or whatever valid records available at the time based on the query; i.e. if you only have 5 interaction records where state = Work in progress then it'll divide it by 5 only) 4) The resulting value would be the average which will then be updated to the \"Average wait time\" field on the location queue record (wu_location_queue)  You can refer the below KB Article for more details: https://support.servicenow.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0722865   Next Steps:  Please look into the above and if you have any questions I'll be happy to assist further.

I will do some troubleshooting in OOB and review with SME and update you with our findings.  Also just to let know I received your last message more than 10 times in case, might be glitch in your system.  Regards, Ashwanthcomments: Hi, not sure why multiple updates were made. It would be useful to know the calculation used for the message displayed to the user and how it differs from the Average wait time on the queue.",

I understand that there is a delay in our response and to provide you with more information and I apologize for any inconvenience caused.  We have reviewed this with our development team and as mentioned by my colleague this is a partner-owned connector (Qualys) and I understand that you have already mentioned that you will raise this with Qualys support, which is appreciated.  As noted by Qualys Support as well, the error code: 409 is referring to a concurrency limit and SN has no role in this.  Regarding the timeout error you are referring to, I suggest we review the concurrency issue first as we suspect this might be linked to the timeout as we have identified this in the same log stack trace.  I will now leave this case in a solution proposed state and wait for you to review the concurrency limit issue with Qualys. However, the case will remain open and please let us know if you see any issues once the concurrency limit issue is resolved.Thank you for your support and cooperation in this regard.Best Regards,Sai Anudeepwork_notes: Auto close workflow is CANCELLED for the casecomments: Hi Sharvan,  Please also refer to the following article from the Qualys community:  https://success.qualys.com/discussions/s/question/0D52L00004TntWrSAJ/api-returning-409-conflict-status-code  I look forward to your response on standby, and I'm sorry for the delayed response and any inconvenience caused.

Not to mention the number of incoming SOAP calls from MID Servers to the instance to reload credentials can potentially cause other performance issues.  The issue is with the following \"AWS SAP\" OAuth Credential: https://neesnprod.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=oauth_credential.do?sys_id=f218061397a7255435b0fb11f053af46  The credential is using this OAuth Provider https://neesnprod.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=oauth_entity.do?sys_id=e668e4cb1ba1a95081b4997f034bcbc1%26sysparm_view=oauth_provider  The expiration time for this credential is very short therefore whenever the Custom integration that Customer is running trying to use this credential, it has to obtain new token and update the credential. https://neesnprod.service-now.com/sys_flow_context_list.do?sysparm_query=name%3DTime%20and%20Attendance%20v2&sysparm_view=  If you go to this cred \"AWS_SAP\", it's created less than 2 months ago and there are already 7.75 million updates on it and counting: https://neesnprod.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=oauth_credential.do?sys_id=f218061397a7255435b0fb11f053af46  Please check with Customer to see if expiration time for the token can be increase so that refreshes is less often which would prevent MID Server from reloading credential too many times as well as avoid other performance issues.work_notes: Unchecking FTS internal update @Reethu Reddy Kanapuram (NOW) Please reviewcomments: Hi Rakesh,  The issue is with the following \"AWS SAP\" OAuth Credential: https://neesnprod.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=oauth_credential.do?sys_id=f218061397a7255435b0fb11f053af46  The credential is using this OAuth Provider https://neesnprod.service-now",

Issue :  Request Items closing when they shouldn't be closing  Findings : In some cases when parent ritm gets closed we can child tasks are still open.  In OOTB we have the same behaviour.  Its possible close parent case though child catalog tasks are open. I can understand as this is not intended business scenario , hence  in  below custom be has been configured:  ====== https://bailliegifford.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=sys_script.do?sys_id=4de5fca3dbc300907a18b9836b96191b ========  Howveer though the custom br exist there are some eg when parent got closed but child tasks are still open.  I was checking latest eg :  RITM0014718 This got closed at 13/06/2023 06:18:07 , and child task got opened almost at same time 13/06/2023 06:18:07  so when the br actually run it may not find active record.  For the original given eg though the timestamp does not match.  While checking this br I noticed If has been used, I will suggest instead of IF use While, which checks all records instead one. ===== if (activeTask.next()) { =========  Also apart from before br, it would be good to have after br also for this.  Also I would strongly suggest dont make the state field editable in form level, rather apply acl so that this field can not be edited. After closure of child task, parent ritm should be closed.  Also you can keep some log statement in this custom br which will help to capture more details.  Please note above are just suggestions, customization is out of technical support scope.  Please  keep an eye if you are facing any similar issue after apply above suggestion please report us immediately.

By this time somehow the state of RITM is changing to closed_complete This is also the flow which can be seen in log stack trace.  I was not able to find any code which is setting the state on RITM  to closed.  I've added some info messages to see if the state is being changed before signaling the workflow are after. But after that i was not able to reproduce the issue. Once this issue is reproduced again, we should be able to see somethings in logs.  Can we also take help form workflow team to get some more insight on why this could occur.work_notes: State for CSTASK559983 (App-ITSM-EE) changed to Closedwork_notes: The blocking task CSTASK559983 with blocking reason Need Task Completion is closed by Ashrit Kumar Samudrala (NOW)u_hop_notes: HOP rights have been granted to user: Ken Walsh (NOW)u_hop_notes: HOP rights have been granted to user: Adrian Murray (NOW)u_hop_notes: HOP rights have been granted to user: Cian McGuinness (NOW)comments: Hi Craig,  Can you do us a favour , and go onto the dev instance to recreate the issue again.
